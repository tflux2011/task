WordPress 6.8 brings a luster and gloss that only a polish release can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.8 Beta 1 contains over 370 enhancements and 520 bug fixes for the editor, including design improvements, polishing the query loop, and more than <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;milestone=6.8&amp;group=component&amp;max=500&amp;col=id&amp;col=summary&amp;col=owner&amp;col=type&amp;col=priority&amp;col=component&amp;col=version&amp;order=priority\">230 tickets for WordPress 6.8 Core</a>. Here’s a glimpse of what’s coming:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Editor improvements</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Easier ways to see your options in Data Views, and you can opt to ignore sticky posts in the Query Loop. Plus you’ll find lots of little improvements in the editor!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Style Book comes to Classic themes</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Style Book now features a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/68036\">structured layout</a> so you can preview site colors, typography, and block styles more easily. You can use the Style Book in classic themes with editor-styles or a theme.json file and includes clearer labels, and you can find them under <code>Appearance &gt; Design</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Support for Speculation browser API</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.8 introduces native support for speculative loading, leveraging the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Speculation_Rules_API\">Speculation Rules API</a> to improve site performance with near-instant page loads. This feature prefetches or prerenders URLs based on user interactions, such as hovering over links, reducing load times for subsequent pages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By default, WordPress 6.8 applies a conservative prefetching strategy, balancing performance gains with resource efficiency. Developers can customize speculative loading behavior using new filters, since the API does not include UI-based controls. The existing <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/speculation-rules/\">Speculative Loading feature plugin</a> will adapt to the core implementation, allowing deeper customization.&nbsp; Please test this feature in supported browsers (currently Chrome 108+ and Edge 108+, with more browsers evaluating) and provide feedback on <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/62503\">#62503</a> to help refine its implementation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Major security boost</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.8 will use bcrypt for password hashing, which <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2025/02/17/wordpress-6-8-will-use-bcrypt-for-password-hashing/\">significantly hardens WordPress.</a> Other hashing is getting hardened, too, throughout the security apparatus. You won’t have to change anything in your daily workflow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The features included in this first beta may change before the final release of WordPress 6.8, based on what testers like you find.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get an overview of the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/6-8/\">6.8 release cycle</a> and check the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">Make WordPress Core blog</a> for<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/6-8/\"> 6.8-related posts</a> in the next few weeks for further details.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Caveat on testing 6.8 Beta 1 in versions older than 5.1</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to an update made to the upgrade routine during this release, (see <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/59803\">r59803</a>), any upgrade from versions older than 5.1 will fail. Folks are working to resolve this specific issue, so please hold off on reporting on this while testing the Beta 1 release.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Vulnerability bounty doubles during Beta &amp; Release Candidate</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress community sponsors a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/#enhanced-bounty-rewards-during-beta-and-release-candidate-phases\">monetary reward for reporting new, unreleased security vulnerabilities</a>. This reward doubles during the period between Beta 1 on March 4, 2025 and the final Release Candidate (RC) scheduled for April 15, 2025.  Please follow responsible disclosure practices as detailed in the project’s security practices and policies.

These fast-paced sessions offered a unique opportunity to discover how leading brands are solving challenges, empowering users, and shaping the future of WordPress.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>YouthCamp</strong>, a dedicated event for kids and teens ages 8-17, offered a full day of free, hands-on sessions designed to spark creativity and introduce the world of WordPress and open source. Through interactive workshops covering web basics, design, and development, participants gained practical skills while exploring the power of building online.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The new <strong>Career and Social Corners</strong> enhanced networking, fostered meaningful connections, and created new opportunities for those within the WordPress community. Career Corner was the go-to space for attendees exploring career opportunities, connecting with sponsors, and discovering exciting new roles. Meanwhile, Social Corner offered a relaxed, lounge-style environment where attendees could engage in informal discussions over refreshments.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Contributor Day</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamp Asia kicked off with an incredible Contributor Day, bringing together almost 800 contributors, many of them new, to collaborate, share knowledge, and give back to WordPress. With 37 dedicated table leads and 16 experts from the Human Library guiding the way, participants of all experience levels engaged in meaningful discussions, tackled important tasks, and made a lasting impact on the WordPress project.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped has-border-color has-darker-grey-background-color has-background

WordPress&#8217; maturity and extensibility provide a high starting point for innovation.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WordPress&#8217; Block Editor has seen tremendous investment, amassing over 34,000 commits &#8211; more than entire competing CMS projects. New capabilities like Full Site Editing (FSE) give enterprises unprecedented ability to enable no-code site building.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Just as being the first user-friendly publishing tool propelled WordPress&#8217; initial growth, AI presents a similar opportunity. WordPress&#8217; contributor community can build not just AI features, but an exciting multi-agent, LLM-agnostic ecosystem representing an intelligent content operating system.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pure-play headless vendors are working backwards to add no-code editing, while WordPress has long supported robust headless capabilities alongside its mature editor.

That challenge is part of the reason I love doing it. There is never a dull day, and the reward of seeing the code you wrote used by the most amazing creators in the world is an indescribable pleasure. <strong>When I see what people create with WordPress, some days I feel like I’m grinding pigment for Leonardo da Vinci or slitting a quill for Beethoven.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In open source, one thing that makes it even harder to ship great software is bringing together disparate groups of contributors who may have entirely different incentives or missions or philosophies about how to make great work. Working together on a team is such a delicate balance, and even one person rowing in the wrong direction can throw everyone else off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s why periodically I think it is very healthy for open source projects to fork, it allows for people to try out and experiment with different forms of governance, leadership, decision-making, and technical approaches. As I&#8217;ve said, forking is beautiful, and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2024/10/spoon/\">forks have my full support and we&#8217;ll even link and promote them</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://joost.blog/\">Joost</a> is a self-proclaimed leader in the SEO space, an industry known for making the web better. He asked for and <a href=\"https://joost.blog/leading-marketing-communication-for-wordpress/\">I gave him WordPress marketing leadership responsibility</a> in January 2019 and <a href=\"https://joost.blog/why-im-stepping-down-from-my-wordpress-marketing-role/\">he stepped down in June of 2019</a>, I think we would both agree in those 5 months he was not effective at leading the marketing team or doing the work himself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://marucchi.com/\">Karim</a> leads a small WordPress agency called <a href=\"https://crowdfavorite.com/\">Crowd Favorite</a> which counts clients such as Lexus and ABC and employs ~50 people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both are men I have shared meals with and consider of the highest integrity. I would trust them to watch any of my 15 godchildren for a day. These are good humans. Now go do the work. It probably won&#8217;t happen on day one, but Joost and Karim&#8217;s fork, which I&#8217;ll call JKPress until they come up with a better name, has a number of ideas they want to try out around governance and architecture. While Joost and Karim will be unilaterally in charge in the beginning, it sounds <a href=\"https://joost.blog/wordpress-leadership/\">like they want to set up</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>A non-profit foundation, with a broad board to control their new project.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A website owned by that foundation which hosts community resources like a plugin directory, forums, etc.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>No more centralized and moderated plugin and theme directories with security guidelines or restrictions are what plugins are allowed to do like putting banners in your admin or gathering data, everything done in a federated/distributed manner.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The trademarks for their new project will either be public domain or held by their foundation.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>&#8220;Modernization&#8221; of the technology stack, perhaps going a Laravel-like approach or changing how WordPress&#8217; architecture works.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Teams and committees to make decisions for everything, so no single person has too much power or authority.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://marucchi.com/wordpress-leadership-continued/\">Karim has a similar post</a>. Joost says he has the time and energy to lead:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So <a href=\"https://twitter.com/photomatt?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@photomatt</a> &#8211; I saw the post by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/automattic?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@automattic</a>.<br><br>I&#39;m ready to lead the next releases. I am sure plenty of people and companies are willing to help me and we&#39;ve got plenty of ideas on what we should be doing.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordPress?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WordPress</a></p>&mdash; Joost de Valk (@jdevalk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jdevalk/status/1877731220135538728?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 10, 2025</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, as core committer Jb Audras (not employed by me or Automattic) points out, within WordPress we have a process in which people earn the right to lead a release:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Before leading any major release of WordPress, please start with leading a minor one <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jdevalk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@jdevalk</a>. Then, apply to be Triage Lead or Coordination Lead Deputy for a major release. These are the steps everyone in our community should follow before claiming to run « the next releases ».</p>&mdash; Jb Audras (@AudrasJb) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AudrasJb/status/1877833087473565785?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 10, 2025</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>However in Joost and Karim&#8217;s new project, they don&#8217;t need to follow our process or put in the hours to prove their worth within the WordPress.org ecosystem, they can just lead by example by shipping code and product to people that they can use, evaluate, and test out for themselves. If they need financial or hosting support is sounds like WP Engine wants to support their fork:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We appreciate <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jdevalk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@jdevalk</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/karimmarucchi?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@karimmarucchi</a> thoughtful call for constructive conversation, change and evolved leadership within the WordPress community. Moments of disruption challenge all of us to reflect and to act.<br><br>WordPress’s success as the most widely used CMS is not the…</p>&mdash; WP Engine (@wpengine) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wpengine/status/1870242287218790849?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 20, 2024</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Awesome! (Maybe it&#8217;s so successful they rebrand as JK Engine in the future.) WP Engine, with its half a billion in revenue and 1,000+ employees, has more than enough resources to support and maintain a legitimate fork of WordPress. And they are welcome to use all the GPL code myself and others have created to do so, including many parts of WordPress.org that are open source released under the GPL, and Gutenberg which is GPL + MPL. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joost also is a major investor (owner?) in <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/\">Post Status</a> (which he tried to sell to me a few months ago, and I declined to buy, perhaps kicking off his consternation with me), so they have a news media site and Slack instance already ready to go. He also is an investor in <a href=\"https://patchstack.com/\">PatchStack</a> and appears to be trying to create a new business around something called <a href=\"https://progressplanner.com/\">Progress Planner</a>, both of which could be incorporated into the new non-profit project to give them some competitive distinctions from WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To make this easy and hopefully give this project the push it needs to get off the ground, I&#8217;m deactivating the .org accounts of <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/joostdevalk/\">Joost</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/pirazo/\">Karim</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/sereedmedia/\">Se Reed</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/idea15/\">Heather Burns</a>, and <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/mor10/\">Morten Rand-Hendriksen</a>. I strongly encourage anyone who wants to try different leadership models or align with WP Engine to join up with their new effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime, on top of my <a href=\"https://automattic.com/\">day job running a 1,700+ person company with 25+ products</a>, which I typically work 60-80 hours a week on, I&#8217;ll find time on nights and weekends to work on WordPress 6.8 and beyond. Myself and other &#8220;non-sponsored&#8221; contributors have been doing this a long time and while we may need to reduce scope a bit I think we can put out a solid release in March.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joost and Karim have a number of bold and interesting ideas, and I&#8217;m genuinely curious to see how they work out. The beauty of open source is they can take all of the GPL code in WordPress and ship their vision. You don&#8217;t need permission, you can just do things. If they create something that&#8217;s awesome, we may even merge it back into WordPress, that ability for code and ideas to freely flow between projects is part of what makes open source such an engine for innovation. I propose that in a year we do a WordPress + JKPress summit, look at what we&#8217;ve shipped and learned in the process, which I&#8217;d be happy to host and sponsor in NYC next January 2026. The broader community will benefit greatly from this effort, as it&#8217;s giving us a true chance to try something different and see how it goes.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"18394\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"WordPress Themes Need More Weird: A Call for Creative Digital Homes\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:102:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2025/01/wordpress-themes-need-more-weird-a-call-for-creative-digital-homes/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 02 Jan 2025 18:53:06 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"Design\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=18358\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:409:\"The modern web has gradually shifted from a vibrant tapestry of personal expression to a landscape of identical designs, where millions of websites share not just similar structures, but identical visual language, spacing, and interaction patterns.

As we collectively gravitate toward the same “proven” layouts and “conversion-optimized” designs, we’re not just losing visual diversity – we’re ceding control over how we present ourselves to the world. This matters because genuine self-expression online isn’t just about aesthetics – it’s about maintaining spaces where authentic voices can flourish.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When every blog has the same hero section, when every portfolio follows the same grid, when every restaurant site looks interchangeable, we create an echo chamber of sameness. The cost isn’t just visual monotony – it’s the slow erosion of the web’s ability to surprise, delight, and showcase truly individual perspectives. WordPress, with its emphasis on complete ownership and control, offers an opportunity to break free from this convergence of design, allowing creators to build digital spaces that truly reflect their unique voice and vision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think of WordPress themes like album covers. They should have personality and create an immediate visual impact. The web has become too sanitized, with everyone chasing the same minimal, “professional” look.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Great themes should:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Have a strong point of view – like how Kubrick (the classic WordPress theme) defined an era with its distinctive header gradient. Don&#8217;t try to be everything to everyone.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Embrace specific aesthetics boldly – whether that’s brutalist design, pixel art, hand-drawn elements, or distinctive typography. Create themes that excite people rather than just working for everyone.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Design for specific use cases – like a theme for photographers that’s all about full-bleed images or a theme for writers that treats typography as art or a theme for musicians that feels like an album cover.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Break some rules thoughtfully – because not every theme needs a hamburger menu. Not every theme needs to be mobile-first. Sometimes constraints create character.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We need more themes that make people say “Wow!” or “That’s different!” rather than “That’s clean and professional.” The web needs more personality, more risk-taking, more fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After spending countless hours digging through the WordPress theme repository, searching for designs that break the mold and spark excitement, I came up nearly empty-handed. Don’t get me wrong – there are plenty of well-built themes out there. But where’s the daring? The personality? The unexpected?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve got a wild theme idea burning in your mind – that portfolio theme that looks like a vintage trading card collection, that blog theme inspired by zine culture, that restaurant theme that feels like a hand-drawn menu – now&#8217;s the time to build it. WordPress desperately needs your creativity, your weird ideas, your willingness to break the visual rules. The future of the web shouldn&#8217;t be a monochrome landscape of identical layouts. Let&#8217;s make WordPress themes exciting again. Let&#8217;s make the web weird again.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 wp-block-gallery-3 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\">\n<figure

My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress, the people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, WordPress, security, and the OSI model, which underpins the entire internet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice, or by going to wptavern.com/feed/podcast, and you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you and hopefully get you, or your idea, featured on the show. Head to wptavern.com/contact/jukebox, and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today we have Robert Jacobi. Robert has a long standing history with the tech and CMS industry, having worked in senior positions at Joomla, Cloudways, Perfect Dashboard and more. He&#8217;s now the Chief Experience Officer at Black Wall, a company formally known as BotGuard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert talks with me today about the transition from proprietary systems to open source, and the seven layer OSI model that underpins the internet. Drawing from his experiences in tech, Robert and I try, and perhaps fail, to break down the complexities of how website traffic is rooted over the internet. This is done to try to understand how Black Wall can position itself to mitigate risks before they reach hosting companies infrastructure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also discuss the evolution of bot traffic on the web, where upwards of 10% of internet traffic is identified as malicious. This kind of insight is particularly important for those interested in the security aspect of web hosting and website management.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also get into Black Wall&#8217;s rebranding journey, and its continued dedication to the WordPress community by participating in events like WordCamp Asia and Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve ever wondered about the unseen layers of internet security and infrastructure, or the strategic moves involved in rebranding a tech company, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to wptavern.com/podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Robert Jacobi.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast by Robert Jacobi. Very nice to have you on. I think I&#8217;m going to muddle up the company that you work for, because a little bird tells me that in the very, very recent past, the company that you work for became, well different in some way. Perhaps a name change, a logo change. Who did you work for and who do you now work for? And are they the same thing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:08] <strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> Well, I still have my original swag, the BotGuard polo, which all of us have at the team, but we are now Black Wall. So Black Wall, formerly known as BotGuard. So we&#8217;ve done a full rebrand. I&#8217;m sure a lot of folks have seen already. But yep, just bringing it forward. Allowing ourselves to take on more of what we do, on top of the highly focused bot security monitoring and mitigation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:32] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay. That&#8217;s a perfect introduction then. So give us your potted bio in tech, in CMSs. I&#8217;m not going to say WordPress because it&#8217;s a bit bigger than that. And maybe just throw in the BotGuard, Black Wall bit at the end there, and what your role is there. So just a couple of minutes. Just tell us who you are and whatnot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:49] <strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> Minutes, I could spend all day talking about myself. So I&#8217;ve been in the industry for a number of years. Mumble, mumble, how long it&#8217;s been. Let&#8217;s go with CMSs because, actually a big passion way back in the day, had an agency where we created our own, of course proprietary CMS because that&#8217;s what you did.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then moved into open source for a number of reasons. Primarily, which I hope all agencies don&#8217;t need to talk about anymore, because I think it&#8217;s pretty obvious. It was the hit by a bus theory that, we put all our eggs into a proprietary basket, and we get hit by a bus, then that customer is stuck. With open source, there&#8217;s the community of the ecosystem, and it&#8217;s huge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, you&#8217;ll always have your preferred vendors for many, many, reasons, but if something happens, you&#8217;re not locked into that code. You&#8217;re not blindsided. That was a fairly quick transition, and wound up working at the time, sorry WordPress universe, went to Joomla because hey, back in that day Mambo slash which became Joomla, was honestly just more of a stack that our team leaned towards. It was MVC based. It was geeky. There were tons of features, and functions that the types of customers we were working with, it resonated with. Especially multilingual at the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fast forward, let&#8217;s say 10 years, and now WordPress is beyond a competing product. It&#8217;s got an ecosystem a, value with its name brand, and literally the immense community that&#8217;s been built around it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From there went to, transitioned off of the Joomla space, and popped into a company called Perfect Dashboard. Oh, I forgot, I actually was the president of Joomla, briefly, so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:31] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Just a little fact there, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:32] <strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> You know what, I should not forget that because that one year felt like 10. It&#8217;s a lot to work with a huge community, for many, many reasons. You have so many stakeholders. People whose lives depend on the product, the solution, the community, the ecosystem. Certainly not going to get into WordPress drama, but I understand how difficult it is to bear those responsibilities. And, it&#8217;s a lot. Immense amount of work. And WordPress has done amazing things in sustaining that for decades.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, moved over to the WordPress side of the universe. Company called Perfect Dashboard. We were acquired. Moved to running the WordPress business unit of Cloudways, also now acquired by Digital Ocean. And today I&#8217;m at Black Wall. I&#8217;m the Chief Experiences Officer for Black Wall. So that includes community, includes evangelism, includes investor in government relations. It&#8217;s really making sure that there&#8217;s an ability to communicate all the things that we do to the right people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:32] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And what does well formally BotGuard, now Black Wall, what do they do? What do they offer up into the market? Is it a WordPress thing, or is it more of a, we&#8217;ll get into the OSI model in a minute, but is it more of an operating system thing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:46] <strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> It&#8217;s at the top of the stack. So while, let&#8217;s just call it 50%, I know that&#8217;s not the exact number, but it&#8217;s close enough that I, think it&#8217;s fair to say, 50% of the web is run by WordPress. We&#8217;re still very heavily involved in the community. So we were just at WordCamp Asia. We&#8217;ll be at WordCamp Europe. These are places want to meet folks, communicate our solution, and engage with hosting providers because, when we get to running through our little OSI stack that you and I are obviously super experts in, we&#8217;ll kinda see where WordPress falls into it and where security matters, up and down that stack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re trying to help WordPress end users and hosting companies before you ever actually have to get to WordPress, because we already see that a significant portion of internet traffic, 40% of internet traffic is bots. AI agents, whatever you want to call them. And 25% of that 40%, so 10% is completely malicious. And you don&#8217;t want to get near the hosting company, the actual application, or anywhere further down the stack if you can avoid it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:50] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So it sounds, just the name, and I confess, I don&#8217;t know much about what BotGuard, Black Wall do, did. But it sounds to me from the naming of it, that it&#8217;s a bit like you are literally a sentinel. You are standing in the way of things. Examining things that are coming your way and saying, no, you may not pass, but you may.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And a bit like throwing it into dev null, if something is unable to pass, you are just black walling it, as it were. You are just saying, nope, off you go, drop, you&#8217;re outta here. Is that basically the principle? You are a security firm preventing things that are bad happening to whoever it is that uses your services.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:25] <strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> Some of it&#8217;s super, super bad, so you&#8217;re going to dev null it. And then there&#8217;s a spectrum of how bad those connections can be. We want to focus on humans getting to human content. Our key, sort of value propositions, humans are secure, humans are actually visiting your site. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there are good bots, and there are good bots who accidentally do bad things. And then there are the bad, bad bots. We obviously want Google to index our sites. We may or may not want Open AI indexing our sites. We certainly don&#8217;t want it. causing an accidental denial of service by how much it&#8217;s scraping our content. Which we have seen many a time. Where it&#8217;s like, great Open AI, come on in, take one quick look and get out. But it&#8217;s like, I&#8217;m going to stay there and I&#8217;m going to churn through everything. And we&#8217;ve seen it and it knocks sites out. And the AI engines, agents are particularly bad about that, because they&#8217;re trying to fill in and understand that data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:25] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. Okay, so we&#8217;ve got some idea of what you do. Just as an aside, what a shame that the internet has a need for a company like yours. I don&#8217;t mean to take the food off your table, but back 20 years ago this just wasn&#8217;t really a thing. Just this promise of the internet to be this philanthropic place with unicorns and rainbows everywhere, where we were all going to throw our content in, and we were all going to consume it and it would be wonderful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now we have well, human beings presumably started the whole thing, but now human beings have written codes such that they can step away and let their robots carry on. And what a shame that we need to have things like captchas on forms. and we need to pay security companies to do all of this stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And again, I&#8217;m not trying to say that your business doesn&#8217;t have a place. Clearly it does. But from a philosophical point of view, I wish that they didn&#8217;t need to exist, because the place was benign and harmless all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:19] <strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> I&#8217;m going to poke a tiny hole in that bubble.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:21] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Please do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:22] <strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> Actually, this is not a bad thing because we&#8217;ve actually moved most of the troublemaking away from us locally. You want to go back 20 years ago and we&#8217;re dealing with Norton Antivirus on everything, and crossing our fingers and praying that something doesn&#8217;t sneak into our immediate homes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve actually been able to, because we&#8217;ve gone to cloud, push a lot of that super local personal risk a bit further downstream. So these security issues didn&#8217;t magically appear, they were much more, in fact, they were much more terrifying before. And I, oh my god, my Windows PC got hacked and now I have to like completely just throw it on the grill, light it on fire five times, and then reinstall Windows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most folks don&#8217;t worry about doing that with their laptops, with their phones or whatnot anymore. The scalable risks are completely different, because me getting hacked was one person. Now a cloud website platform application, and then I&#8217;m, 10 million people get hacked. But we&#8217;re pushing it further away and away and away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:24] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s interesting. I remember in the dawn of computers that I had, I didn&#8217;t begin my computer journey right at the very, very beginning. You could walk into a store and walk out with a computer in more or less, every town and village in the country, when I began using them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the media, the way that you got things onto the computer was a physical thing. You held the object in your hand. It was either a CD or some kind of media that you could physically hold. And now of course literally nobody is installing anything off a CD. And so I guess the, inexorable rise of the internet, and everything coming down a, well, telephone line, and we&#8217;ll get into that in a moment. Putting it in the cloud makes way more sense, doesn&#8217;t it? It doesn&#8217;t really seem to have so much utility having the antivirus, if you like, on the computer. I know it does, don&#8217;t get me wrong. But I can see that the shift to mitigating the risk and detecting the risk and doing something about the problem in the cloud. Obfuscated, abstracted away, so that you never even really know what&#8217;s going on is probably the best way forward. So, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:25] <strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> For 99.9 9, 9 9 9% of people, they&#8217;re not going to know or understand that they just want it to work. They don&#8217;t want to be robbed from, or in danger online. I always put it, as techy as I appear to be, I am the worst car person on earth. So when I think about internet security and what most people want to know about it, it&#8217;s pretty much what I want to know about cars.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want my car to turn on. Go forward, go backward, get me to where I need to be as safely as possible. I don&#8217;t know, or care about anything else that&#8217;s going on under the hood. It&#8217;s a tool that I use and I want it to work like I expect it to work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:04] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. Given the population at large, it must be, one in a hundred thousand who care about the internals of their machine, probably even less so. Doesn&#8217;t matter really what you&#8217;re using, be it Mac, Windows, Linux, Chromebook, whatever it is, you just to flip the lid open and you want to just.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:18] <strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> Check my email, log into my social media, buy something, call it a day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:23] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> But because it&#8217;s becoming an increasingly crucial part of our lives. Certainly where I live in the UK, more or less everything has gone online that&#8217;s of any use. So shopping has gone online. Appointments for doctors have gone online. Dentists, it&#8217;s gone online. Pharmacy appointments, it&#8217;s all gone online. Paying your taxes, it&#8217;s online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so we really do need to protect this stuff. Really need to protect this stuff, because if it&#8217;s possible to, I don&#8217;t know, inject some problem in that path, we&#8217;re not just going to take out the beautiful experience of buying from a shop. We&#8217;re going to take out our ability to get fuel into our houses and into our cars and all of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:58] <strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> Yeah, if you need that prescription, you don&#8217;t want that to go down, so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:01] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s become almost like, almost like a human right. That seems a bit of a ridiculous thing to say, but on some level, it seems like the internet or access to the internet is almost on that level. It certainly feels like it is as important as other key parts of the country&#8217;s infrastructure. So power and gas all of that, and the road network and what have you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:20] <strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> It is the information utility. So you have your power utilities, you have an information utility. It&#8217;s got to be available. In the States we always have our last mile issues, especially for very rural folks, about how connected are they, how fast is it? We always do this to ourselves. We got this great new toy, now let&#8217;s see how, great we can make it. Yeah, but if you&#8217;re not running at a hundred megabits a second your experience might really not be functional.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:46] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So we&#8217;re going to talk today about something that I confess, I don&#8217;t know anywhere near enough of. So, Robert and I have shared an article, and I&#8217;ll put the article in the show notes. And essentially this thing that we&#8217;re going to talk about is what&#8217;s called the OSI model. And the OSI model comprises various different layers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And basically, dear listener, if you&#8217;ve never thought about the gubbins of your computer, you, might just have this fairy tale notion that you open it up and start typing and it just works. I can send an email, of course I can send an email, you just click send and it&#8217;s gone and that recipient receives it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the breathtaking quantity of things going on in the background disguised from you. Really, honestly, Robert, none of this should work, and yet it does work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:36] <strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> Which is why I love my car analogy. I have no idea what is going on 99% of the time. I still have a gas car, so I know there&#8217;s a larger motor than an electric car. I know gas gets in there and lit on fire and moves pistons around, but really, in the most abstract sense of it. It goes, and that&#8217;s what I want it to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:56] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> There&#8217;s explosions happening all the time, and fuel is being funneled around, and things are turning because they&#8217;ve been lubed with oil and all of that. And honestly, your car is nothing compared to the internet. The complexities in the internet, because I know that electric cars have taken over from, or are taking over from gasoline cars, but broadly speaking, the gasoline engine probably hasn&#8217;t changed terrifically much in the last a hundred years. Whereas I think the infrastructure comprising the internet, although the OSI model probably hasn&#8217;t changed much either.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The things that are coming down the pike, and the things that have happened in the last 20 years, it&#8217;s breathtaking. So, dear listener, get out your tinfoil hat as Robert and I attempt and probably butcher what the OSI model is. And if you&#8217;ve got the capacity. Perhaps pause this podcast, go to the wptavern.com website, search for this episode and read the article. And the one that Robert came up with, which was a good one, is called What is the OSI model? It Standardizes How Computer Networks Communicate, and it&#8217;s on bluecatnetworks.com, but I&#8217;ll provide the link.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:00] <strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> The best one I found that had the good pictures to also help. Because visually it&#8217;s hard to, you think you have a server, some wires and a browser and it&#8217;s like me saying I have an engine, some gas, and a steering wheel. There&#8217;s a lot of pieces that go in between all those parts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:18] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> The amazing thing is this all happens really at the speed of light and. Okay, a perfect example is Robert is literally half a world away from me, and I&#8217;m talking to him through a browser, and I imagine that there is the most fractional delay between the words that I&#8217;m saying and him hearing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s probably like a thousandth of a second or something. And yet somehow that sound and that image is getting consumed by my camera. Traveling down a cable. Getting into my computer. The computer&#8217;s making decisions about, what the heck am I going to do with this? And then pushing it down a wifi network.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That wifi network is then thinking, where do I put this thing? And then it puts it there. That then decides to shunt it along somewhere else, which shunts it along somewhere else. And eventually it gets to Robert&#8217;s computer. Robert&#8217;s computer does all of it in reverse. Unpacks it rather than packing it up, and puts it on the screen. And it&#8217;s all happening like thousands of times a second, and it shouldn&#8217;t work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:20] <strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> It&#8217;s more live than live.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:22] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:22] <strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> Because not only do we have the video, we have a chat window on the side. It&#8217;s all encapsulated. Use some of these acronyms, but, we have our streaming protocol for the actual video and audio. And then we have our standard internet protocols for the content and everything else that&#8217;s holding the streaming protocols together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s crazy. Why I&#8217;m excited to have this conversation with you is like, I feel, very anecdotally, but people are like, I&#8217;m just going to spin up a WordPress site. I&#8217;m going to be a WordPress agency. And they just do it. And there&#8217;s just all this stuff in the mix that, while it&#8217;s great to take for granted, it might help to know just a few of the pieces that are critical in that security portion of infrastructure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:05] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, it feels to me like a bit like you&#8217;ve been to a really nice restaurant and you&#8217;ve eaten a fabulous meal, and then you realize the 12 hours of labor that went into creating that tiny little sauce on the side or something like that. And you get real appreciation for it. And hopefully something like that will come out of this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, caveat emptor, we&#8217;re not going to get everything right. Please feel free to give us a comment when we do get things wrong. But the OSI model is basically, it&#8217;s a seven layer stack and I think we&#8217;ll start at layer seven, because it sounds easier to describe it from the top down. So seven through one. And I&#8217;ll just say what all the layers are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they go from the application layer, that&#8217;s layer seven. Presentation layer is six. The session layer is five. Four is transport. Three is network. Two is data link. And then the final one is the physical layer. And this point, I completely stand back and say, Robert, tell us a little bit about the top one, and Robert puts his hands on his head, the application layer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:06] <strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> It&#8217;s funny, it&#8217;s like the top most layer and the bottom most layer are the, I feel, the easiest to like grok. Let&#8217;s use geek terms, to understand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The application layers is as well as a WordPresser, I can explain. It&#8217;s really the top, you&#8217;re connecting from the client, your client application, so a browser, email, whatever, with specific protocols.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And what we primarily use is TCP IP, because that&#8217;s that magical thing that is able to grab a bunch of information, split it up into a billion pieces, and somehow put it all back together. How are we communicating with other devices is the way I look at that layer. It&#8217;s very high level, very abstract, it&#8217;s sort of fundamental. It&#8217;s like the air we need to breathe to actually get stuff done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s the layer, if I&#8217;m correct, it&#8217;s the layer closest to us, the user. It&#8217;s the layer which we can most readily understand, because it&#8217;s the layer closest to which we do things. So I think maybe a poor example, or an incorrect example, would be to imagine it&#8217;s something like Microsoft Word or something like that. Because it isn&#8217;t, the application itself isn&#8217;t that layer. It&#8217;s more how that interacts with the protocol underneath. So it might be HTTPS or FTP or something like that. But you are writing an email or something like that, and you hit send, and then the application layer gets in the way and says, what do we do with this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:38] <strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> Bingo. That&#8217;s exactly it, so we use all these, and generically they&#8217;re just called clients. So whether it&#8217;s Word, Microsoft Word, whether it is Safari, whether it&#8217;s Chrome, whether it&#8217;s Apple Mail. This will only entertain a few people, or Eudora mail. Just taking it back. Those are discreet applications on our devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the application, to your point, you hit send, you hit go on your browser. And now we&#8217;re like going crazy, okay, what do we do? We have a request. A request needs to go somewhere. That&#8217;s where the application layer kicks in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:11] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So we have this protocol in the application layer, which then makes decisions about what to do. And each of the layers is collapsing into the layer below it. And that layer then takes something that the previous higher layer gave to it and does, some shenanigans with it, and we get something which can then move into the layer below.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:30] <strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> Everyone knows the application layer, because we&#8217;ve all typed in HTTPS://. That is literally the application layer request.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:40] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, so in the case of a browser, it&#8217;s the capacity for the browser to send something through HTTP, what have you. And then we get into the presentation layer, which is the layer beneath. And I think, again, I&#8217;m just cribbing from this article, if I&#8217;ve parsed this correctly, it says that this layer comprises things like translation, encryption, decryption compression. And it turns all of the bits and pieces into machine readable data. So for example, it says it will convert all of the binary ones and zeros into machine readable data. If the devices are using a different communication method, the presentation layer translates that data into something understandable, so that it can be received from layer seven.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there&#8217;s a lot more to it than that. It&#8217;s like this layer of converting what came to it, into something else, which can then be moved down the stack into five.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:34] <strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> Bingo, that&#8217;s literally exactly it. And it&#8217;s something us as humans completely don&#8217;t interact with unless you&#8217;re the person building out that infrastructure. It&#8217;s really just we&#8217;re having computers talking to computers at this point. So when you typed in HTTPS WP Tavern, that was your human interaction. Now we&#8217;re all like, what is the process? So presentation is making sure that that data moves forward the stack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:59] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And my understanding as well is that this is the moment where encryption and decryption occur. And so it&#8217;s high up in the stack. That is to say it&#8217;s near the layer seven, because you obviously can&#8217;t have it encrypted before you do anything with it. It&#8217;s high up in the stack so that at this moment, before it&#8217;s gone anywhere, it has become encrypted, before it&#8217;s passed down the stack and sent down the wires. But also, this is the moment if it&#8217;s coming up the stack, towards you so that you can read it in your browser, so that it&#8217;s getting decrypted at the last possible moment as well. So the encryption, I guess is at the first possible point on the way out, and the last possible point on the way back in. Have I got that right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:40] <strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> Yeah, and that&#8217;s a great way to look at it is, when we look from the top of the stack to the bottom of the stack, it&#8217;s almost in physical proximity to you as the human end user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:48] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:49] <strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> Because at first you&#8217;re typing in something. Now something&#8217;s happening, that encryption is happening locally, because otherwise it wouldn&#8217;t be safe. And as we get further down the stack, you are physically further away from what&#8217;s going on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:02] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. And the other thing that&#8217;s going on here is compression. So you&#8217;ve got some giant blob of data that the stack can compress to make it more efficient to fly over the wires, then that will be handled at this layer as well, is my understanding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:17] <strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> We have compression on the servers as well in the applications layer as well. Don&#8217;t forget, you can compress data on the protocol.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:22] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So that all sounds really remarkable, but also quite humanly understandable, because everything that I&#8217;ve said makes perfect sense. And we start from five down. It starts to be really the domain of networking experts, and people who really obsess about computers and understand this stuff. But if you&#8217;re just the person using the web and WordPress casually, honestly, it may be that you&#8217;ve never come across this stuff, and I found it just breathtaking, to be honest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So layer five, is called the session layer, and it is literally that. It&#8217;s managing sessions, so it&#8217;s figuring out who&#8217;s connected to who. How that communication should begin. How it should end. When it&#8217;s decided that, okay, that connection should be destroyed. We&#8217;re not using that anymore, but okay, now we&#8217;ve got something else that we need to do. And it figures out, yeah, sessions basically, which I guess is the easiest way to describe it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:15] <strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> Everyone knows what a session is. It&#8217;s me being connected, and my information being managed for me, so that when I log in, Nathan doesn&#8217;t get all my information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:24] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And also, an understanding here is that usernames and passwords, so authentication is happening at this layer as well. And again, that kind of makes sense. So you would have to authenticate before the decryption happens in the layer above and vice versa. But yeah, this is opening up connections between, in this case, you and I are chatting in a browser, so we&#8217;re occupying one session, and then there are million, literally millions of packets of data just flying around over the internet via who knows what route. They&#8217;re all going in completely different routes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:57] <strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> Some of these packets can literally be going through Australia or South Africa or Brazil, and back and forth and they, catch up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:05] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Incredible, isn&#8217;t it? Literally. It&#8217;s like, I don&#8217;t know. Imagine getting a handful of rice and chucking it all down on the floor, but it assembles itself into a tower. It just lands and it just assembles itself. That&#8217;s basically what we are dealing with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:19] <strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> That&#8217;s a good one. Yeah, like I have my own rice tower at home. I throw it on the ground. It gets shipped by FedEx to you, but when you open up the box, it reassembles itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:28] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Just in perfect condition, yeah. So the next layer four, is the transport layer. And this is the bit which actually I guess begins the process of sending my stuff to you, and your stuff to me. And typically the protocols for that are something called UDP, which is User Datagram Protocol or TCP Transmission Control Protocol.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And my understanding, which is very basic, is that UDP differs from TCP in that UDP can be more of a stream of data, because it doesn&#8217;t require everything to come through perfectly to say, yeah, that&#8217;s now finished. So a perfect example would be us talking to each other, streaming. If bits get lost along the way, it doesn&#8217;t want to say, right end the call.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We haven&#8217;t got one bit. We need to just stop. Until that bit has been found, it just keeps going and just disregards the missing bits. Whereas TCP, this is just incredible. This is the rice tower, isn&#8217;t it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:28] <strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> TCP is the rice tower, exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:30] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It requires every single piece to be sent. Acknowledged. Counted out. Counted in at the destination, and for the both ends of the connection to be saying, did you get that bit? Yeah, I got that bit. What about this bit? Did you get that bit? Yeah, I got that bit. 23, did you get 23? No, 23 has gone. Where, where&#8217;s 23? Oh, I&#8217;ll send 23 again. Here it is. A million times a second for this conversation that we&#8217;re having. Well, it&#8217;s probably not a million times a second, but you know what I mean.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;ve summed that up very badly, but these packets of data that are flying around. They egress my computer. They go through 7, 6, 5, now we&#8217;re in 4, and they&#8217;ve got to go through further layers. But they&#8217;re not just going in a straight pipe, like a hose pipe from your faucet, spraying the garden. These are just going anywhere they choose. So one packet, like you said, might go via Australia, one might go through South Africa, and then somehow they just reassemble themselves magically at the other end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:26] <strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> Routers, because that&#8217;s what those do. Obviously that&#8217;s a physical component further down the pipe. They&#8217;re saying, this is the order of information. I&#8217;m going to just spew out, and everyone else needs to figure out how to put it back together, one piece. It&#8217;s crazy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:38] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, it is crazy. My understanding is that back in the day, when the internet was conceptualized, I think it was possibly something like Darpanet, or something like that, but it was a, I think it was a military endeavor, the enterprise was something along the lines of, we need a communication system which if various nodes are taken out, let&#8217;s say, I don&#8217;t know, bombed out of existence, or just the power is cut, the system is intelligent enough to just work round the problem, and figure, okay, we can&#8217;t go there anymore, let&#8217;s just go a different way. And that is what we now have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:12] <strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> It&#8217;s all about redundancy. I&#8217;m going to take just a slight tangent on federated social media. Any kind of federated application. Those exist in a lot of ways to ensure redundancy. I&#8217;m going to go way, way back, to where most of the audience probably wasn&#8217;t born. So we had these things called modems, and they would be attached to a phone, and you would run something called a bulletin board system. Those were single points of failure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you actually saw groups of independent bulletin board system providers create these distributed federated networks. So if you sent an email to a specific person, at a specific BBS, if that phone line was busy, it could go to another one that would take it, and keep pushing it along until you actually got it to the right place. This idea of distributed and federated systems is really what makes the internet functional because we take care of failure points. We ignore them and just work around them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:17] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And obviously we know that works as well because parts of every country&#8217;s infrastructure are breaking all the time. One router somewhere will just go down, even if it&#8217;s a crucial router, it doesn&#8217;t in the end stop the system. It probably creates bottlenecks in various places.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:31] <strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> Slow it down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:32] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Slow the egress of traffic around, yeah. But in layer four we&#8217;re dealing with the ports that things fire out of as well. And then when we get down to layer three, that&#8217;s when the actual data is divided up into little packets and little segments. So data four and data three, honestly, to some extent they feel very similar in my head at least anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But layer three is using things like IP addressing, to decide where this packet&#8217;s going to go. And I think wraps the packets up in the IP address, if you like. It&#8217;s almost like wrapping up a Christmas present and as it travels down the stack, by the time it gets to layer three, it&#8217;s being told, this is not what it&#8217;s being told, but this encapsulates it. This is a gift for Robert Jacobi. You must find Robert Jacobi.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then it reads that, and then finally, it&#8217;ll rip off the wrapping and finally give you the gift at the end as it goes back up the stack. So, there&#8217;s not a lot to say on layer three, I don&#8217;t think, other than it&#8217;s using things like IP v4 and IP v6 to make decisions about how it&#8217;s going to be spread around. Have I got that about right? Do you think?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:35] <strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> That works for me. I think that&#8217;s enough information for most folks. Again, we&#8217;re trying to give a taste of how complex security is, for what we do day to day. But also how we can apply it to how WordPress understands it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:48] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And then we&#8217;ve got the two layers where, the data link layer and the physical layer. The data link layer is handling the data transferred. So the actual data moving around. So it&#8217;s getting pushed around on the same network is my understanding for layer two. So that&#8217;s when you are, for example, in the same office building. I think layer two is just for that. I could be wrong.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:11] <strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> It&#8217;s getting to your router and then your router will start moving stuff around. Cause don&#8217;t forget, your router is on your network as well as any other computer in that closed. So, our 192&#8217;s. Our internal network, so that&#8217;s the closest on the networking side, that hardware side, because as soon as it hits our router it goes to the cable, or whoever you&#8217;re using, outside of your office, home, your LAN.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:35] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And then the final layer, the physical layer is the cables, the actual infrastructure out there in the world outside of your house, basically. Or your office building. Well, maybe there&#8217;s some of it in the office building as well, but the majority of it, the miles and miles of things are all in the physical layer. And it says here on the bit that I&#8217;m reading. Finally, this layer encompasses the equipment that carries data across the network, such as fiber network switches, and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so finally, our packets of data that we started off at the beginning, writing the email to Robert Jacobi. Finally, that packet has made it out. It&#8217;s escaped into the wild, and is now just rattling around on the internet desperately being told, very quickly, where to go. And then hopefully it&#8217;ll arrive. Travel to Robert&#8217;s computer. Travel in the reverse direction of the stack, and he&#8217;ll get a nice email from me with cat pictures in it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:27] <strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> Why is it always cat pictures?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:29] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Why not? Okay, so all of that shenanigans is happening, and honestly, I feel a, it&#8217;s very difficult if you&#8217;re inexperienced like me, to get the words out in the correct order so that I have demonstrated that I understand it. Because I do on a very, very slight level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I know that entire careers, very, very, well paid careers can be built upon really understanding what we&#8217;ve just spoken about. But in there, I presume, is the capacity for threats, and the capacity for things to go wrong, and the capacity in all of these layers for people to inject things which shouldn&#8217;t be there. For clever people to figure out ways to disrupt that information. To take that information. To delete that information. To rewrite that information. And is that essentially what your company does? Prevent those things?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:18] <strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> So when I look at it from a CMS stack, and again, let&#8217;s focus on WordPress. My mental model that is slightly different. I&#8217;ll use, I think what most of us feel like is WordPress infrastructure. I know, the really smart folks are going to yell at me for this. You have a server somewhere. It has an operating system, it has PHP, MySQL, it has WordPress, and then whatever else is in front of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s a whole stack and layer on layers of communication that go from when I hit my browser and type in WP Tavern and hit go. And let&#8217;s move away from all the really highly technical networking protocol issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At some point, it&#8217;s going to make a request to a hosting company that needs to be able to say, oh, yes, let&#8217;s give them the WP Tavern homepage. In that process there are caching services, firewall products, local security on the networking side of that hosting company. What I feel personally, but also which is what makes products like Black Walls critical is, detect and defend as far away from the website as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if there are a million bots coming at you, get them before they even hit the hosting company&#8217;s infrastructure. Some will always sneak through because it&#8217;s a battle that&#8217;s just never ending and, you&#8217;re going to keep learning and fighting and learning and fighting. Mitigate the risks as close to the bad actor, and as far away from the site as possible. So, mitigate, mitigate, mitigate, mitigate, mitigate. And there are tools and solutions up and down that entire stack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you&#8217;re going to have stuff way before you hit the hosting company. You&#8217;re going to have some solutions closer to the hosting company. You&#8217;re going to have solutions directly on WordPress. There are security plugins that are running on your install of your site. Those are great. I personally feel that you don&#8217;t want to even get that close if you&#8217;re a bad actor. Mitigate that problem as quickly, as soon as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And even solutions that work at the operating system level, or at least the language level. There are products out there that are constantly monitoring, looking for and mitigating PHP corruption. So, you really don&#8217;t want to let everyone have access all the way down to that level, because then you&#8217;re already, you will have problems, how to put it nicely. We don&#8217;t say bad words on the show.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:53] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So do you sell your product into the WordPress space? So, you know, to freelancers, agencies, or are you more at the hosting level, or is it even more like infrastructure level? So at the router level. So in our case, this sort of physical layer that we were talking about. Is that the kind of place where your products go? I honestly don&#8217;t know where your product sits in all of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:16] <strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> So, if you look at it from a hardware perspective, there&#8217;s going to be the end user is going to make request. It&#8217;s going to get routed somewhere. We sit between where it&#8217;s getting routed and the hosting company. So our goal is to prevent the hosting company from wasting physical resources. Now we need to amp up our service because there&#8217;s so much traffic coming in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now we need to amp up our customer support because more stuff is happening with our virtual machines or hosted infrastructure. So that&#8217;s our place in the universe. Get the bad guys before they get to the critical infrastructure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:51] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And another question, forgive my ignorance. Is Black Wall&#8217;s solution, is it software? Is it code that sits on an operating system? Or maybe you even have hardware that sits in the way of things, the packets have to transfer through your hardware and be inspected in a way, like a router might get in the way of those things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:10] <strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> Our secret sauce is that we are software that emulates the hardware that used to be required. So there are hardware companies buy this kind of routing and prevention, traffic mitigation. And we do it on the software side so that you as an agency or MSP, if you&#8217;re running a bunch of virtual machines, you can deploy this on your own. Certainly as a hosting company, you can deploy this across your entire enterprise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:36] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So you are dealing with very technical, the people that purchase from you they&#8217;re not me, for example. They are very technical. They&#8217;re in the data centers. The sort of technical end of the hosting companies. They understand what I&#8217;ve just butchered during this episode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not like a freelancer market. You will not be selling Black Wall as a plugin. You are dealing with, directly with hosting companies and the tech side of those hosting companies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:01] <strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> There&#8217;s a wonderful German word called Jein. So yes and no.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:04] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Oh, that is a good word.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:05] <strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> For all the Germans listening. You still want to be able to control a lot of times exactly what kind of traffic comes in. You might want to get scraped by AI bots more than someone else does. Or you might want to turn off all scraping if you&#8217;re an e-commerce store and you&#8217;re worried about people taking your pricing and not allowing you to sell at your level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve had, and are currently reworking our entire WordPress plugin, to enable that end user control of that infrastructure. So it&#8217;s not running on your WordPress install, which is great because it&#8217;s not taking up resources, filling up your hard drive. But you can control, as an end user, the granularity of the traffic that&#8217;s able to access your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:45] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Oh, so you have a plugin, so you are reading what the hosting company is doing. You can view it through a GUI on your WordPress website, but you are not actually, it&#8217;s nothing to do with your WordPress install. You&#8217;re getting the data from your hosting company, and that is another layer away from you. Okay. That&#8217;s interesting. I didn&#8217;t realise that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:04] <strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> Yes, it empowers all these website owners, agencies, MSPs, to fine tune, for lack of a better term.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:10] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. And then do you offer a sort of GUI for data breakdown, tables, graphs, charts, and ways to block things that you imagine are suspicious, and alerting and things like that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:20] <strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> Yep, as well as defaults for all sorts of things of course, just to make life easier for folks. You can go and visit our site and get some initial monitoring for your site for free. We enjoy having that as part of just an offering of the reporting and monitoring, you can see it. My traffic has been great, and then all of a sudden you look and it&#8217;s oh wait, it&#8217;s just been Chat GPT.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:40] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Sad realization that the million visitors that seemed to be going to your excellent article were in fact Chat GPT.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:47] <strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> Bots stealing that information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:49] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Sadly, time has got the better of us. We&#8217;re at the time where Robert has to walk away. I know he&#8217;s got a hard stop. Firstly, my apologies, dear listener for utterly butchering the OSI model. I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s a lot of geeks out there who were just throwing things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:01] <strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> They&#8217;re going to kill, but my hope is everyone looks it up, a lazy Sunday afternoon understanding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:06] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Exactly. And that, really was my capacity to understand it. Doesn&#8217;t matter how much more I read it, I will be able to get no more out of it. But an important conversation, and one that we&#8217;ve never had before. We never get into the weeds of all of that. It&#8217;s always WordPress all the way down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this is what&#8217;s happening before, WordPress gets to put the bits and your screen. So really important and hopefully, like Robert said, it will encourage people to go and have a little look.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert Jacobi, thank you so much for chatting to me today, and good luck with the new rebranding of BotGuard into Black Wall. I hope that goes well too. Thank you so much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:39] <strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> Thank you Nathan.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-jacobi/\">Robert Jacobi</a>.<br /><br />Robert has a long-standing history with the tech and CMS industry, having worked in senior positions at Joomla, Cloudways, Perfect Dashboard, and more. He&#8217;s now the Chief Experience Officer at <a href=\"https://blackwall.com/\">Black Wall</a>, a company formerly known as BotGuard.<br /><br />Robert talks with me today about the transition from proprietary systems to open source, and the seven-layer OSI model that underpins the internet. Drawing from his experiences in tech, Robert and I try, and perhaps fail, to break down the complexities of how website traffic is routed over the internet. This is done to try to understand how Black Wall can position itself to mitigate risks before they reach hosting companies infrastructure.<br /><br />We also discuss the evolution of bot traffic on the web, where upwards of 10% of internet traffic is identified as malicious. This kind of insight is particularly important for those interested in the security aspect of web hosting and website management.<br /><br />We also get into Black Wall&#8217;s rebranding journey, and its continued dedication to the WordPress community by participating in events like WordCamp Asia and Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve ever wondered about the unseen layers of internet security and infrastructure, or the strategic moves involved in rebranding a tech company, this episode is for you.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://blackwall.com/\">Black Wall</a> (formerly BotGuard)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.joomla.org/\">Joomla</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cloudways.com/en/\">Cloudways</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/\">Digital Ocean</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://bluecatnetworks.com/glossary/what-is-the-osi-model/\">What is the OSI model?

editor sidebar </h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-right has-large-font-size\">[theme author] [site admin]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Site Editor sidebar is getting increasingly powerful, serving as the entry point to manage all things on your site. Until this version, the Styles panel offered limited style settings, focusing on style variations, color palettes, and typographies. WordPress 6.8 changes this by introducing a full-fledged Global Styles panel in its place, giving users site-wide granular control of styles at the top level.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"652\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/gutenbergtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image.png?resize=652%2C369&ssl=1\" alt=\"Site editor sidebar with more design tools\" class=\"wp-image-38038\" />\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"swifter-hiding-and-showing-the-template\">Swifter hiding and showing the template </h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-right has-large-font-size\">[theme author][site admin]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Switching between editing your site templates and content pages should be as smooth and seamless as possible; sometimes, you need to focus on the post content and hide the rest of the template. This was previously possible in the post settings, but now it is much easier thanks to the <strong>Show template</strong> toggle directly on the preview dropdown in the top toolbar.</p>\n\n\n\n		\n			<div class=\"jetpack-videopress-player__wrapper\"> <div class=\"toolbelt-video-wrapper\"></div></div>\n			\n			\n		\n		\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"style-book\">Style Book </h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-right has-large-font-size\">[theme author][site admin]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Style Book provides a comprehensive overview of your site’s colors, typography, and block styles in an organized layout. Each block example and style group is labeled, making it easy to preview and understand your theme’s current design settings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Think of it as if your theme threw a party, and all the design elements showed up wearing name tags. 😀</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\"><em>Ramon Dodd, release lead of <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/12/18/whats-new-in-gutenberg-19-9-19-december/\">Gutenberg 19.9</a>&nbsp;</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The Style Book can be accessed in two ways. The first option is via the Styles menu item in the left sidebar. The second option is available when editing theme elements via the right Styles sidebar. This was already available in WordPress 6.7.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With WordPress 6.8, opening the Style Book from the left sidebar <strong>Styles</strong> menu shows subsets of blocks and makes them available for site wide editing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you click on <strong>Typography</strong> you can preview all text-related blocks, and adjust options and settings. You can preview and modify specific blocks via the <strong>Blocks</strong> option.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Style Book also received some performance improvements to ensure a more fluid user experience.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Give the Style Book its own route so it can be linked to directly (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/67811\">67811</a>).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Scroll to top at the styles root (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/67605\">67605</a>).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Try splitting the Style Book into sections (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/68071\">68071</a>).<br /></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n		\n			<div class=\"jetpack-videopress-player__wrapper\"> <div class=\"toolbelt-video-wrapper\"></div></div>\n			\n			\n		\n		\n\n\n<p>For classic themes that support the Style Book, site patterns have been relocated to <strong>Appearance &gt; Design &gt; Patterns</strong>, consolidating all design-related functionality from the Site Editor into one place. Previously, patterns were listed under<strong> Appearance &gt; Patterns</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Support is available for classic themes that either support editor styles via add_theme_support( &#8216;editor-styles&#8217; ) or have a theme.json file (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/66851\">66851)</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"zoom-out-view\">Zoom Out&nbsp;View </h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-right has-large-font-size\">[theme author][site admin][end user]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Zoom Out view, users can now apply different section styles and designs directly from the toolbar, cycling through them and inspecting them in the context of the rest of the page. This enhancement streamlines the decision-making and production process (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/67140\">67140</a>).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"652\" height=\"326\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/gutenbergtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-2.png?resize=652%2C326&ssl=1\" alt=\"change design in block toolbar\" class=\"wp-image-38045\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The Block options on the block toolbar only lists Copy, Cut, Duplicate, and Delete for sections in Zoom Out view (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/67279\">67279</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"538\" height=\"291\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/gutenbergtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-1.png?resize=538%2C291&ssl=1\" alt=\"Zoom out view with only four choices in toolbar options dropdown. \" class=\"wp-image-38044\" />\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the added Zoom Out icon in the toolbar, users can also invoke Zoom Out view via the Keyboard shortcut <kbd><strong>Shift command + 0</strong> </kbd>on a Mac and <strong><kbd>Shift + Ctrl + 0</kbd></strong> on Windows (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/66400\">66400</a>).

When it comes to border and spacing support, the block editor itself provides granular controls within individual blocks, allowing users to define border widths, styles, colors, and radii, as well as precise padding and margin adjustments. These controls facilitate the creation of visually distinct elements and well-structured layouts. The work for WordPress <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/06/20/roster-of-design-tools-per-block-wordpress-6-6-edition/\">6.6</a> and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/10/17/roster-of-design-tools-per-block-wordpress-6-6-edition-2/\">6.7</a> was continued for WordPress 6.8 to provide all design tools to all blocks, where possible.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this release, the following blocks received border support</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Comments (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/66354\">66354</a>),</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Comments Link (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/68450\">68450</a>),</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Comments Count (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/68223\">68223</a>),</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Latest Posts (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/66353\">66353</a>),</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Page List, also received color and spacing support (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/66385\">66385</a>),</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Content, also spacing support (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/66366\">66366</a>),</li>\n\n\n\n<li>RSS, also spacing support (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/66411\">66411</a>),</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Archives, also color support (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/63400\">63400</a>), (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/68685\">68685</a>), and</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Query Total (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/68323\">68323</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond those, the Category block supports color options as well (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/68686\">68686</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the Post Content block, the color support via the sidebar Design Tools has been brought up to feature parity with the options available via theme.json. Now users and designers can adjust colors for all heading levels in addition to text, background, and link (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/67783\">67783</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"652\" height=\"399\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/gutenbergtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-5.png?resize=652%2C399&ssl=1\" alt=\"post content block not has additional text color options. \" class=\"wp-image-38049\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Another user experience improvement can be found in the list of fonts: Each font family is now previewed in the font picker dropdown and gives users a better indication as to what the font will look like (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/67118\">67118</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"652\" height=\"326\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/gutenbergtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-4.png?resize=652%2C326&ssl=1\" alt=\"preview of fonts in drop down\" class=\"wp-image-38047\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/?p=117323&preview=1&_ppp=6a618f26dc\">Roster of design tools per block (WordPress 6.8 edition)</a> gives you a complete overview of the available Design Tools per core block.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"updated-core-blocks\">Updated Core Blocks&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"buttons\">Buttons&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-right has-large-font-size\">[theme author][developer]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.8 adds a small piece of code (`box-sizing: border-box;`) to the styling of buttons. Imagine you’re putting a picture in a frame. You want the picture to fit nicely within the frame’s borders. That’s what `box-sizing: border-box;` does for buttons (and other elements) on a website. It tells the browser to include the border and padding of an element in its total width and height (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/65716\">65716</a>)</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"cover-block\">Cover Block</h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-right has-large-font-size\">[theme author][site admin][end user]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Images used as backgrounds in Cover blocks now come with resolution controls so that you can change their sizes. This works with both an uploaded background image or the already assigned featured image. This adds to the more granular control for designers and theme developers. (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/67273\">#67273</a>), (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/62926\">62926</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"details-block\">Details block</h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-right has-large-font-size\">[theme author][site admin][developer][end user]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In WordPress 6.8 the Details block is now more flexible to use and has received some quality-of-life updates:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The addition of the name attributes field in the<strong> Advanced</strong> panel of the block’s settings. This allows a group of Details blocks to be connected and styled if needed.&nbsp; (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/56971\">56971</a>)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"652\" height=\"327\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/gutenbergtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-6.png?resize=652%2C327&ssl=1\" alt=\"Details block name attributes in editor\" class=\"wp-image-38050\" />\n\n\n\n<img width=\"652\" height=\"142\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/gutenbergtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-7.png?resize=652%2C142&ssl=1\" alt=\"shows FAQ name attribute in front end\" class=\"wp-image-38051\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The summary content is used as the label in the List View which makes it quicker to identify the block and allows for easier reorganizing of content (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/67217\">67217</a>).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"652\" height=\"145\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/gutenbergtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-11-at-15.21.19.png?resize=652%2C145&ssl=1\" alt=\"Shows Details block summary in List View\" class=\"wp-image-38075\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The Details block also receives anchor support via the <strong>Advanced</strong> panel, allowing users to create anchor links to specific Details blocks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the help of the allowedBlocks attributes, developers can now control what blocks content creators can use in a Details block.

For WordPress 6.8 contributors added <strong>Expand to click </strong>to the Gallery’s toolbar to open all images in a light box effect, with one click. The option is available from the <strong>Link</strong> toolbar button (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/64014\">64014</a>).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"652\" height=\"316\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/gutenbergtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/AD_4nXdZktcc02nZIQCghCLmAjPOUF9cts60_MlovrgelL5oT4xU480bq0RYIprDaLwmVhTjB1qNRTs6CpG8kd8Sj5BQeba3Gsdnn2W1exYyAdFogZLijRlHbLlWrP3lz5fhd5WBxH-xog.png?resize=652%2C316&ssl=1\" alt=\"Gallery block now with Expand on click link option. \" class=\"wp-image-38072\" />\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"image-blocks-and-handling\">Image Blocks and handling</h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-right has-large-font-size\">[end user][site admin]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The outcome of the Image manipulation methods are now better communicated in the block editor.

However, it can be easy to forget to set one! To help set featured images more easily, Image blocks now offer a dropdown action to directly set them as the featured image of the post or page containing the block (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/65896\">65896</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"652\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/gutenbergtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/AD_4nXdkffQ7hXMMD38hOaoXiHfIu410IrvEMmxgV295KxHLjPwxKj8DLHE1bGLpbotOmqnLliyrwh-zTRWY3rhTTiiAxjpZQLndv2NXwqwLPkw1V4MmZsYjJNf0tAhpKClTIEpg5sYv7A.png?resize=652%2C369&ssl=1\" alt=\"Displays bock toolbar option dropdown with Set featured image\" class=\"wp-image-38073\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Another WordPress 6.8 update also changes how the Image block handles those cool overlay styles aka filters (like a semi-transparent color wash) designers might add on top of images. It’s making the way these styles are applied more efficient and reliable. Details on CSS changes can be found in the PR (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/67788\">67788</a>).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"navigation-block\">Navigation Block</h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-right has-large-font-size\">[end user][site admin][theme author]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The theme of polish also continues for the Navigation Block.

Caveat: the used Theme needs to register support for post formats (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/66037\">66037</a>)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Pages, content creators will find two additional sorting options: <strong>Ascending by order</strong> and <strong>Descending by order</strong>, which allows for a display following the page attribute page_order (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/68781\">68781</a>).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Video: https://videopress.com/v/CN22ETfh</p>\n\n\n\n		\n			<div class=\"jetpack-videopress-player__wrapper\"> <div class=\"toolbelt-video-wrapper\"></div></div>\n			\n			\n		\n		\n\n\n<p>Looking to replace your Query Loop block’s design?

To add a URL to the icons, you now only need to press the arrow key once. This certainly streamlines the content creation process.

The Shadow panel and the Duotone settings also received a very handy reset button. Instead of the need to remove settings one at a time, designers can quickly start over.

It lists the page layouts that are otherwise available via the New Page modal. If a user has disabled the starter content&nbsp; pop-up when creating new pages, this category surfaces the page layouts, should they be needed. (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/66819\">66819</a>) The Inserter now also always shows all the available patterns in a list.

For example, all header patterns are added to the &#8220;header&#8221; folder, all footer patterns into the &#8220;footer&#8221; folder, testimonials patterns into the &#8220;testimonials&#8221; folder, and so on. (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/62378\">62378</a>)</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"data-views-updates\">Data Views updates&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This release also contains quite a few Data Views improvements:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A user can modify the amount of whitespace that is displayed per row on three levels: comfortable, balanced, and compact.&nbsp; (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/67170\">67170</a>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can now set your site’s homepage from the Site Editor via the page’s actions menu (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/65426\">#65426</a>). This is the equivalent of updating the Reading Settings in <strong>Settings &gt; Reading.</strong> Under <strong>Pages</strong> in the editor, find the page you’d like to set as your homepage, click on the action menu, and select <strong>Set as homepage</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All delete actions now show a <strong>Confirm to delete</strong> modal, to safeguard against accidental removal of templates, patterns, or pages. (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/67824\">67824</a>)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is a list of PRs with more Data View changes:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Add: Media field changing UI to Data views and content preview field to posts and pages. (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/67278\">67278</a>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Add combined fields support. (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/65399\">65399</a>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>DataViews Fields API: Default getValueFromId supports nested objects. (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/66890\">66890</a>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>DataViews list layout: Hide actions menu when there is only one action and is primary.

Previously, it could only loop through arrays or objects with a .map method. Now, it supports any <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols#built-in_iterables\">iterable value</a>, including strings, arrays, maps, sets, and <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function*\">generator functions</a>. Additionally, it can handle undefined or null values by subscribing to changes and updating automatically when the value becomes iterable.(<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/67798\">67798</a>)</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"block-hooks-api\">Block Hooks API&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In WordPress 6.8, work continues on improvements to the Block Hooks API.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Block Hooks API now supports dynamically inserting blocks into post content. (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/67272\">67272</a>) A typical example would be a plugin that provides blocks that can be used in posts and that would like to provide extensibility for those blocks. The Block Hooks API will now also work with Synced Patterns. (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/68058\">68058</a>)</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"security-enhancements\">Security enhancements</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Various security-related enhancements made it into WordPress 6.8, the most significant of which is <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21022\">the switch to using bcrypt for password hashing</a>. This includes improvements to the algorithm that’s used for storing application passwords and security keys. The dedicated post <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2025/02/17/wordpress-6-8-will-use-bcrypt-for-password-hashing/\">WordPress 6.8 will use bcrypt for password hashing</a> covers these changes in detail. You will find a <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?group=status&component=Security&milestone=6.8\">list of all security updates in 6.8</a> on WordPress Core Trac.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"support-for-speculative-loading\">Support for Speculative Loading</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Building upon the success of the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/speculation-rules/\">Speculative Loading plugin</a>, which has over 40,000 active installations, WordPress 6.8 integrates speculative loading into core. This feature utilizes the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Speculation_Rules_API\">Speculation Rules API</a> to prefetch URLs dynamically based on user interaction, aiming to improve performance metrics like Largest Contentful Paint (LCP). The current proposal has a default configuration employing conservative prefetching to ensure safety and compatibility, but feedback is requested on this. Developers have access to filters for customization, allowing adjustments to the speculative loading behavior as needed (#<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/62503\">62503</a>). Details are laid out in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2025/03/06/speculative-loading-in-6-8/\">Speculative Loading in 6.8</a> Dev Note.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"additional-performance-improvements\">Additional Performance improvements</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For the WordPress 6.8 release, several key performance improvements have been implemented in the block editor and collectively contribute to a more responsive and efficient editing experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>To address performance issues in the site editor when handling navigation blocks with multiple submenu. The isBlockVisibleInTheInserter selector was improved to prevent unnecessary computations, resulting in a more efficient block editor experience (#<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/68898\">68898</a>).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>This release also introduces the withSyncEvent action wrapper utility to streamline event handling, reducing potential performance bottlenecks (#<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/68097\">68097</a>). A Dev Note is in the works.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"accessibility-improvements\">Accessibility improvements</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.8 includes <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&focuses=~accessibility&milestone=6.8&col=id&col=summary&col=status&col=focuses&col=owner&col=type&col=priority&order=priority\">26 accessibility improvements</a>.

These concepts are critical for improving your visibility in search engine results, but putting them into action can feel like a daunting puzzle. Whether you’re a book author, a blogger, or someone with a diverse portfolio of written work, creating a strong web presence is essential to establishing your authority. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Author SEO goes beyond just writing great content – it involves technical elements like schema markup and consistent author profiles to signal credibility to search engines. But how do you bring all these moving parts together to create an effective strategy?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this guide, we’ll explore actionable steps to optimize your author bio pages and build a consistent online presence. From <a href=\"https://gravatar.com/\">Gravatar</a> integration to schema markup, these techniques will help you strengthen your E-E-A-T signals and achieve better search rankings.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Building author E-E-A-T through optimized bio pages</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Establishing E-E-A-T is essential for authors striving to improve their visibility online. According to <a href=\"https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/hsw-sqrg.pdf\">Google’s Search Quality Rater Guidelines</a>, high E-E-A-T pages are deemed more trustworthy, which can directly impact rankings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your author bio page is a prime opportunity to strengthen your position. Here’s how to optimize each component:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Experience</strong>: Share milestones like years of writing, notable projects, or awards. This helps showcase your firsthand knowledge, making your expertise relatable and credible.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Expertise</strong>: Highlight qualifications such as degrees, certifications, or industry recognition. These reinforce your authority on your subject matter.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Authoritativeness</strong>: Link to your published work on reputable platforms, which positions you as a trusted source. Tools like Gravatar ensure your online presence remains consistent.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Trustworthiness</strong>: Build trust by including testimonials or reviews. A professional headshot and clear contact details further enhance reliability.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep in mind that an optimized bio page is more than just an introduction to your readers – it signals your credibility and authority to search engines and readers alike.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you have a strong bio page in place, the next step is integrating tools like Gravatar to maintain consistency across all platforms.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Creating consistent author profiles with Gravatar</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1397\" height=\"716\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/gravatar-new-homepage.png\" alt=\"Gravatar homepage\" class=\"wp-image-2851\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Being consistent across all your digital profiles can help you build a solid and trustworthy online presence, and <a href=\"https://gravatar.com/\">Gravatar</a> simplifies this process. This platform links your profile picture and key details – like your name, bio, and website – to your email address, ensuring that your information is automatically updated across supported websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"457\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ronnie-gravatar-profile-2.png?w=660\" alt=\"Example of a completed Gravatar profile – Ronnie Burt\" class=\"wp-image-2853\" />\n\n\n\n<p>For authors, Gravatar eliminates the hassle of managing profiles manually on multiple platforms. Whether it’s a WordPress blog, an online portfolio, or a <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/07/11/enable-comments-in-wordpress/\">comment section</a>, Gravatar ensures your professional identity remains uniform, building trust and reinforcing your E-E-A-T.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Setting up Gravatar is straightforward: Create an account, upload a professional photo, and fill in your details.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1452\" height=\"1123\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/gravatar-about-section-1.png\" alt=\"Example of the Gravatar profile dashboard – Editing the About section\" class=\"wp-image-2854\" />\n\n\n\n<p>From there, Gravatar takes care of the rest, providing flawless integration and a polished, consistent online presence. This not only saves time but also enhances your credibility, making it an essential tool for any author looking to strengthen and <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/12/02/how-can-you-manage-your-digital-footprint/\">monitor their digital footprint</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://gravatar.com/connect/?gravatar_from=blog\"><img width=\"3243\" height=\"729\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/free_profile_cta.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2616\" /></a>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>WordPress integration and cross-platform syncing</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>According to W3Techs, “<a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress#:~:text=WordPress%20is%20used%20by%2062.0%25%20of%20all%20the%20websites%20whose%20content%20management%20system%20we%20know.%20This%20is%2043.6%25%20of%20all%20websites.\"><em>WordPress is used by 62.0% of all the websites</em></a><em> whose content management system we know. This is 43.6% of all websites.</em>” So, it’s no wonder that so many authors, writers, and contributors go with WordPress as their platform of choice.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravatar integrates perfectly with WordPress, automatically displaying your avatar across the WordPress ecosystem wherever your email address is linked, such as in blog posts, comments, or <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2025/01/07/wordpress-author-box/\">author pages</a>. This standard integration helps maintain a consistent online identity with minimal effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, for authors looking to go beyond the basics, the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/gravatar-enhanced/\">Gravatar Enhanced plugin</a> offers additional features. Unlike the default Gravatar setup, which only pulls the <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/07/19/wordpress-profile-picture/\">profile picture</a>, this plugin provides greater customization options, allowing you to display more detailed author profiles, including <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/11/11/how-to-list-social-media-handles/\">links to your social media</a> and published works.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1226\" height=\"793\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/gravatar-profile-block-customized-2.png\" alt=\"Example of a customized profile block with the Gravatar Enhanced plugin\" class=\"wp-image-2855\" />\n\n\n\n<p>You can also control how your Gravatar appears on various sections of your WordPress site, such as post bylines and author widgets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of that, with Gravatar you can create multiple profiles each linked to a different email address, and you can pull any of these easily with the Gravatar Enhanced plugin. This is invaluable if you write across different genres or target audiences (more on that in a second).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re tech-savvy or have the budget to work with a developer, and have many people contributing to your website, you can also take advantage of the <a href=\"https://docs.gravatar.com/api/profiles/rest-api/\">Gravatar REST API</a>. This gives you more flexibility and granular control over exactly what data gets imported and displayed on the website. It also makes it much easier for guest authors to contribute – their Gravatar profile information will be automatically imported.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This applies to every single <a href=\"https://docs.gravatar.com/integrations/\">platform that has integrated Gravatar</a>, including <a href=\"https://github.com/\">GitHub</a>, <a href=\"https://slack.com/\">Slack</a>, <a href=\"https://openai.com/\">OpenAI</a>, <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/\">Figma</a>, <a href=\"https://zapier.com/\">Zapier</a>, and many more.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"268\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/companies-using-gravatar-logos.png?w=660\" alt=\"Logos of websites that have integrated Gravatar\" class=\"wp-image-2856\" />\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Managing multiple author identities</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For authors who write across different genres or target diverse audiences, managing multiple online identities can be a challenge. Gravatar simplifies this with its ability to associate multiple email addresses with unique profiles. Each profile can feature a distinct avatar, bio, and contact details, allowing you to tailor your online presence to specific audiences or platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To use a different profile with Gravatar Enhanced , you just need to put the email address corresponding to that profile.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"225\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/gravatar-profile-block-in-editor-1.png?w=660\" alt=\"Importing a Gravatar profile through email and the Gravatar Enhanced plugin\" class=\"wp-image-2857\" />\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, if you write technical guides under one pen name and fiction under another, Gravatar ensures your profiles stay separate and relevant. By linking each email to a unique profile, you maintain consistency and professionalism for both identities without any crossover confusion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This flexibility helps you maintain your E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) across different niches, ensuring that each identity aligns with its intended audience while reinforcing your credibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Technical SEO essentials for author pages</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Optimizing the technical side of your author pages can help your site rank well in search engine results and provide an easy and memorable user experience. Here are some key areas to focus on:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Page speed and mobile responsiveness</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Fast-loading, mobile-friendly pages are a must. Use tools like <a href=\"https://pagespeed.web.dev/\">Google PageSpeed Insights</a> to identify performance bottlenecks and ensure your site is accessible on all devices. Reasons for a slow website include:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Large image files</strong> – High-resolution images that aren’t optimized can significantly increase load times.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Too many HTTP requests</strong> – Each image, script, or CSS file requires a separate HTTP request, slowing down the site.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Unoptimized JavaScript and CSS </strong>– Heavy or poorly written scripts can delay rendering, especially if they aren’t minified or compressed.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Lack of browser caching </strong>– Without caching, users have to download site elements repeatedly, even if they’ve visited before.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Slow server response time </strong>– Poor hosting or high traffic can lead to delays in how quickly the server processes requests.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Bloated plugins</strong> – Excessive or poorly coded plugins can slow down the backend and frontend of the site.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Unoptimized database</strong> – A database cluttered with unnecessary data, like old revisions or spam comments, can slow query times.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>High traffic without proper resources</strong> – A <a href=\"https://pressable.com/features/automate/wordpress-scalability-customization-hosting/\">sudden spike in visitors</a> can overwhelm your hosting plan, leading to slowdowns.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever the issue is, make sure you fix it on time since most users access the web via mobile, a <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/06/05/user-profile-page-examples/\">responsive, clutter-free design</a> helps with usability and improves your search rankings.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Schema markup for author pages</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Implementing schema markup helps search engines understand your content better. Use the “Author” schema to display rich snippets, such as your name, bio, and image, directly in search results.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"440\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/christopher-paolini-example-author-google-snippet.png?w=660\" alt=\"Example of an author page on Google Search Results\" class=\"wp-image-2859\" />\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Canonical URLs and structured navigation</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ensure each author page has a unique, canonical URL to prevent duplicate content issues. Structured navigation, including breadcrumbs, helps search engines and users understand your site’s hierarchy, improving crawlability and the user experience. They are also essential for screen readers and users who only use keyboards to navigate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Secure and accessible design</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A secure site (HTTPS) is critical for building trust with both users and search engines. Additionally, ensure your content is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities, by adhering to <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/\">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</a>. Here are some of the main areas you need to consider:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>If you have a shop for your books, events, or services, make sure that users can successfully complete a purchase with any assistive technology, including screen readers and keyboard navigation.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Create <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/\">functional and descriptive alt text for your images</a> and files. Users should be able to understand the main idea behind each image and if it’s only decorative, just leave the alt text tag empty.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Make sure your link texts make sense – “click here to book a spot for my book signing” is much better than just “click here.”</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use accessible fonts and ensure that <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/resize-text.html\">users can scale text up to 200%</a> without the loss of functionality and content.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Meta descriptions and optimized headings</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Every author page should have a compelling meta description and properly structured headings (H1, H2, etc.). These elements improve click-through rates and help search engines identify the page’s main focus. They are also essential for accessibility: The meta descriptions and titles are what the assistive technologies will read out loud to people who use them and want to search online.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Implementing author schema markup</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Schema markup helps search engines understand the structure and content of your author pages, boosting visibility in search results. By implementing author-specific schema, you can enhance your E-E-A-T signals, making your pages more appealing to both users and search engines.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"183\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/author-schema-markup.png?w=660\" alt=\"Example of a rich snippet of an author website\" class=\"wp-image-2860\" />\n\n\n\n<p>For blog authors, use the <a href=\"https://schema.org/Article\">Article schema</a> to mark up your blog posts, including details like the headline, author name, and publication date. For book authors, the <a href=\"https://schema.org/Book\">Book schema</a> is ideal. It highlights properties like the book title, ISBN, and author information, making your work easier to find​.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/example-book-schema.png?w=660\" alt=\"Example of a book Google snippet\" class=\"wp-image-2861\" />\n\n\n\n<p>You can then implement the schema on your website with the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/webmasters/markup-helper/u/0/\">Google’s Structured Data Markup Helper</a> or WordPress plugins like <a href=\"https://rankmath.com/\">Rank Math</a> and <a href=\"https://yoast.com/\">Yoast</a>. You can tag relevant sections of your page, such as your name, bio, and links to your published works, and generate JSON-LD code for seamless integration​.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To get the most out of schema markup, make sure you:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Include key details: </strong>Author name, profile image, and links to verified profiles.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Stay consistent across platforms</strong> by syncing with Gravatar, which adds a professional touch to your author bio.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Validate your schema</strong> with Google’s Rich Results Test to check for errors and ensure all required fields are present.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Measuring and improving author page performance</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Optimizing your author pages doesn’t stop at implementation – you need to measure their performance and refine them over time. Here’s how:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Key metrics to track</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Organic traffic</strong> – Use tools like <a href=\"https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/\">Google Analytics</a> to monitor how many users find your author pages through search.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Bounce rate</strong> – A high bounce rate could indicate poor user experience or irrelevant content.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Time on page</strong> – Longer time spent suggests that visitors find your content engaging and valuable.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Search rankings</strong> – Track keyword rankings for your name, book titles, or blog posts using tools like <a href=\"https://search.google.com/search-console/about\">Google Search Console</a>, <a href=\"https://ahrefs.com/\">Ahrefs</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.semrush.com/\">SEMrush</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Improving author page performance</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Enhance content</strong> – Ensure your bio includes relevant keywords, links to authoritative publications, and an engaging summary of your work.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Optimize for mobile</strong> – Many visitors will access your page from mobile devices, so ensure your layout is responsive and user-friendly.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Leverage internal linking</strong> – Link to related blog posts, books, or interviews to keep users engaged and improve site navigation.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Update regularly</strong> – Add new publications, awards, or noteworthy achievements to keep your page fresh and relevant.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Use heatmaps and session recordings</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Heatmaps (e.g., from tools like <a href=\"https://www.hotjar.com/\">Hotjar</a>) show which parts of your page users interact with most, helping you refine layout and content.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1593\" height=\"865\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/example-heatmap-hotjar.png\" alt=\"Example of a Hotjar heatmap\" class=\"wp-image-2862\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Session recordings provide deeper insights into user behavior, highlighting any obstacles they encounter. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Enhance your author authority now</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As AI-generated content continues to flood the web, a verified and consistent author profile is the best strategy to help you stand out and maintain reader trust. A strong, recognizable presence builds credibility and helps search engines and audiences alike see you as a reliable source.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the tips outlined in this article, you’ll lay a solid foundation for optimizing your author website. Start with a polished bio, leverage schema markup for better search visibility, and use Gravatar to maintain a consistent online identity. With its “Update Once, Sync Everywhere” functionality, Gravatar ensures your avatar and profile details are synchronized across platforms, saving you time while <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/04/10/personal-branding-tools/\">keeping your branding professional</a> and cohesive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The key to successful author SEO lies in the trinity of a professional bio and website, technical SEO, and an up-to-date Gravatar profile.

My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, creating a successful business in enterprise WordPress, and working to foster the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice. Or by going to wptavern.com/feed/podcast, and you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you and hopefully get you, or your idea, featured on the show. Head to wptavern.com/contact/jukebox, and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Rahul Bansal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rahul is the founder and CEO of rtCamp, a large agency that specializes in enterprise grade WordPress projects. He began his journey quite differently, starting as an individual blogger back in 2006, discovering WordPress in 2007, and gradually transitioning from being a publisher to a freelance developer, before founding rtCamp in 2009.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, rtCamp is an enterprise grade WordPress consultancy agency operating globally and trusted by clients such as Google, Meta, Automattic, News UK and Al Jazeera.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rahul sheds his light on working with enterprise clients in the WordPress space. Many of us are familiar with WordPress in the context of small businesses and blogging, but the enterprise space demands additional layers of security and scalability. Rahul explains the factors that set enterprise projects apart, and why meticulous code reviews, and security audits are essential when working at this level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He talks about the opportunities in the enterprise space, recounting how rtCamp initially stumbled into enterprise level projects, not even realizing their potential until a client&#8217;s high expectations led to a decision to market themselves as an enterprise agency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also discussed the role of WordPress in enterprise environments, from why Gutenberg has become a credible selling point due to its powerful editing capabilities, to how the platform&#8217;s flexibility supports varied enterprise needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rahul also gets into the importance of positioning. How historical context offers advantages, and the expanding market that makes WordPress a compelling choice for large clients today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards the end, we explore rtCamp&#8217;s innovative intern program, aimed at growing the WordPress talent pool, and the way they&#8217;re contributing back to the WordPress project, a win-win for the business and the broader community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve ever considered what it takes to work with WordPress at the enterprise level, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to wptavern.com/podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you, Rahul Bansal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Rahul Bansal. Hello.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:47] <strong>Rahul Bansal:</strong> Hello.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:48] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It is very nice to have you on the podcast today. We&#8217;re going to talk about the enterprise, which I confess is something that I only really know about because people talk about it. I&#8217;ve never worked in the enterprise, I&#8217;ve never worked with enterprise clients. So Rahul is here. He&#8217;s very much in the enterprise as you&#8217;re about to find out, and he&#8217;s going to educate me all about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So Rahul, I wonder if you wouldn&#8217;t mind just for a minute or two minutes, just tell us who you are, what you do in the WordPress space, where you work, your position there, and so on. A little potted bio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:18] <strong>Rahul Bansal:</strong> Currently I am founder and CEO of rtCamp, which is a large agency specifically dealing in enterprise grade WordPress projects. I started quite differently, like I started as a individual blogger, back in 2006.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2007 I found WordPress. I started developing with WordPress in 2007. And slowly from being a publisher, I become freelance developer, and then around 2009 rtCamp started. So I&#8217;ve been with rtCamp for the last 16 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:46] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s been quite a journey. I see the name rtCamp everywhere. And we should just say, so it&#8217;s spelt, lowercase r, lowercase t, and then Camp with a capitol C, a m p. Go and Google that, and have a look at what the team over there doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How big has the team grown to? How many employees, staff do you have over there now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:05] <strong>Rahul Bansal:</strong> So currently we are 230 people, all spread over.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:08] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That is truly an enormous agency. So bravo for growing that. That&#8217;s really incredible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first question that I want to ask though is, when does normal WordPress become enterprise WordPress? At what point do we cross the Rubicon where a site is, I don&#8217;t know, big enough, or your agency is working with a different type of client? Can you define what you think that means? And I&#8217;m sure that if you&#8217;re on the cusp of being an enterprise agency, this is something that, you know, may be slightly confusing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:37] <strong>Rahul Bansal:</strong> Firstly, there is no formal definition to that. Many agencies believe they&#8217;re serving enterprise space when they&#8217;re not. Some people are actually serving enterprise space, but they don&#8217;t realise it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in my opinion, it&#8217;s where the requirement changes a lot. Like, for example, if we&#8217;re building a small WordPress site, which I don&#8217;t consider as an enterprise site, we will be tempted to pick first theme and plugin that matches our need, like if it works, if it gets a job done, that&#8217;s it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then in enterprise space, there is a lot of security and scalability concerns. These two concerns are very big. Something might be working all right, but then when you look at the code, you realise that there&#8217;s going to be a security issues, or there could be scalability issues. Many times, indy developer person, they design small WordPress plugins. They don&#8217;t have data or big enough site to test it on a large installation. So those things are not tested on really high traffic website. So enterprise can mean really high traffic website, with a lot of scalability requirement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, the traffic can be less, but the security requirement can be enormous. Consider the White House website. It was on the WordPress with the previous administration, and it&#8217;s again, on the WordPress with the new administration. So in both cases, I don&#8217;t think White House, like a website we can classify as a very high traffic website, but it is a very sensitive website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It would be a lot embarrassing if that site gets hacked. So every piece of code that goes into White House website, which agency is working on it, will be thoroughly checked for security attack, for audit, for all the compliances. And this additional efforts is what makes it enterprisey, in my opinion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, so it&#8217;s not necessarily the size of the client, or the fame, for want of a better word, of the client. It&#8217;s more about the kind of work that you&#8217;re doing in the background. So custom code largely, because you simply at that scale cannot have something off the shelf.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:28] <strong>Rahul Bansal:</strong> So we can have things off the shelf. The thing is, you cannot just take it and use it. You still have to own it in that sense. Like, for our clients also, we go and use many things from WordPress plugin directory. But then when we put it on this website, it is kind of like signed by us. So it&#8217;s like we have to verify, even if it is not coded by us, we have to verify line by line that it is following best coding practices, database queries will scale with high traffic, if it is a high traffic website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many checks and balances in place. So no matter if you are doing in-house, like as a custom coding, or we are buying a premium plugin or using a free plugin, everything has to go through certain checks. And those checks are very expensive to do, because that&#8217;s a human labor. You have to literally go through things line by line. And in many cases, you have to put extra efforts to make it scalable with their existing system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because usually a large enterprise won&#8217;t use just a website in silos. It&#8217;ll be part of multiple system like authentication system, where if an employee joins a large organisation based on some rule, they might get automatic access to their website. Likewise, if they leave organisation, their access should be automatically revoked, or they have some CRM integrations, data integrations, some kind of asset, like digital asset management solution integration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So all these have to be connected, and this all need to work together. So a lot of effort goes in doing these extra things, which are either don&#8217;t exist for small websites. So, enterprise website that I&#8217;m talking about, this can be really unknown website. We have a client which is basically a government public origin fund. Common people don&#8217;t even know about them, but they basically want pretty much all the big companies we know. Like, they have stake in all the big companies. Their asset is something like $400 billion in under management.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most people don&#8217;t even know that company. But then it&#8217;s very sensitive because that money they&#8217;re managing is public money, it&#8217;s not like VC fund. It&#8217;s actually state reserve. Now, seriousness, we need to demonstrate in the security is very high, because if something gets hacked or somebody uploads the wrong investor report or something like portfolio report, it can have a lot of consequences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:32] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It kind of sounds to me as if the assurance that you are giving an enterprise client is basically that what we&#8217;ve built is, as far as we can tell, it&#8217;s bulletproof. We&#8217;ve gone through it line by line. We may have custom coded bits and pieces, but certainly the bits that we didn&#8217;t custom code, we are totally guaranteeing that this is going to be robust.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also it&#8217;s sounds a bit like, if a client at an enterprise level approaches you and they say, can you do this? Your answer is yes. Basically, yes, we can do it. We can do it with WordPress. There may be a cost, but we can do it. There&#8217;s almost no scenario where a client would come to you and say, can you do this, forget the money, can you do it? The answer&#8217;s never no. The answer&#8217;s always going to be yeah, yeah, we&#8217;ll figure it out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:15] <strong>Rahul Bansal:</strong> So that&#8217;s the thing, like if the budget has no limit then there is no limit on technology. Most often, like even where enterprise agency, WordPress has this large spectrum. So we end up with a lot of low quality leads, where somebody knocks on an enterprise agencies&#8217; door and they really have budget constraint. They really want something really good out of the box, but they don&#8217;t want to pay for it. Or they don&#8217;t want to pay as high as it&#8217;ll require to deliver that kind of solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For some enterprises, budget is no limit, but then we try to be mindful of resources. For example, many enterprise agencies, including us, if you go to their GitHub account, they would have list of published themes and plugins. Most commonly plugins, themes rarely are used off the shelf. So we will build these plugins to ensure that the cost of rebuild project is less, like if we have to deliver another project, we try our best that we reuse as much as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s the open source spirit, that the entire WordPress committee follows. We use many times solutions that are already put in open source by our competing agencies. They also use our solution. So that&#8217;s where the enterprise solution with WordPress is also affordable. The right enterprise client that we target, usually have higher budget than we would need to develop because we are competing against a lot of experienced managers, which are very expensive, super expensive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when I is super expensive, I&#8217;m just talking about licensing fees. Before you hire an agency to write custom code for you, you have already paid a lot of money just for the right to use the software. With WordPress, that right to use costs zero. And then all the nice agencies in WordPress space, big, small, no matter what size they are, try their best to reuse existing solutions, to bring the cost down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So enterprise WordPress, relatively, cost less than other enterprise CMS, but then it certainly costs a lot than building a small website. Like, you cannot go to an enterprise agency and expect in $500 your site to be built perfectly, because the requirement gathering phase, like talking to all stakeholders and understanding all the solutions they use inhouse can take like many days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:15] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So you may have answered this question just now with what you&#8217;ve just said. I feel that you&#8217;ve definitely gone into this territory, but it sounds like there&#8217;s a lot of line by line checking of everything. So for example, if you use a plugin off the repo, you&#8217;re going to go through that one line at a time. And you said this can be an expensive process. You&#8217;ve also said that obviously there&#8217;s benefits of using WordPress because you can take things that other people have used and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I guess at some point there&#8217;s got to be some sort of tipping point where you think, okay, WordPress is going to be good for this project, but it might not be good for that project. Is it always WordPress for you? Do you always lean into WordPress, or does there come a point where you say, do you know what, with the custom things that this particular client wants and what have you, lets just build the thing ourselves, let&#8217;s not rely on the CMS, or do you always lean in on WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:01] <strong>Rahul Bansal:</strong> Maybe it&#8217;s the nature of our positioning that we rarely get things that we cannot do in WordPress, so we always do things in WordPress. The boundary varies with how much off the shelf WordPress we&#8217;ll use, and how much custom we&#8217;ll use. In one of the project, I remember there was a specific data crunching process that we needed to build. And we felt that it&#8217;ll be better if it is built as a microservice and run independently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we built that in Python, but then it was talking to WordPress REST API. So that freedom we have from client, for example like that microservice, that microservice was never visible to any of the client&#8217;s editorial team. Everything they were doing, their only interface was WP admin. There was no second login or no second interface to them. It was just something was running on some server and magically data was going inside and outside WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s the power of WordPress. It has so many APIs to communicate with outside world, like rest API, GraphQL, and even from the traditional XML-RPC. That WordPress can coexist with other systems very nicely. And that&#8217;s where we never face that, can we do this on WordPress or not? It&#8217;s like, can we do everything on WordPress, or do we need to put some minor things outside WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And those decisions are not the engineering limitation. Like, that microservice, we could have put it in WordPress also, but we felt that its architecture was more suited for independent microservice. That was the right call, it turned out to be right call. Much later that microservice grew independently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:26] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> If we rewind the clock to the beginning when you were just beginning with WordPress and beginning the agency that ended up being rtCamp with your 230 odd employees, did you intend for what&#8217;s happened to happen? Did you always know that you wanted to grow something to the point where it became, air quotes, enterprise with many, many employees, or did it just evolve over time unexpectedly?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:49] <strong>Rahul Bansal:</strong> Yeah, it all happened unexpectedly. Like, I started as a professional blogger. I used to make money from advertising, affiliate marketing. So it&#8217;s like, I wasn&#8217;t doing anything remotely related to agencies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So one thing led to another and then I started freelancing. Then even after freelancing, when I started rtCamp as an agency, because I was coming from bloggersphere, most of my initial client were bloggers, like independent bloggers. Somebody wanted a theme, somebody wanted a plugin, somebody wanted a sidebar, which sidebar just used to be a lot more popular in those early days of blogging. Like, people used to have MySpace, like experience on the web, like lots of widgets, email submission form, this pop up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in fact, the first enterprise client that walked into our door, that&#8217;s why I said like many agencies don&#8217;t even realise when they mingle with enterprise space. I kind of felt very irritated because they asked so many questions. They got our reference from LinkedIn. We had zero, we were not even using enterprise word anywhere in our branding, marketing, anywhere at all. But back in 2010, also, we made a good name for ourselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So anybody who shouted, hey, any WordPress references, our name used to pop up on social media. So we got that. And they sent us a very large procurement checklist, which we never heard of. All of our projects were like email exchange, two, three emails, money via PayPal, and emails used to be contact. Like, whatever you committed on email is the contract.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And suddenly there comes like this long PDF, Excel sheets with check boxes. Do you have a data storage policy? This policy, that policy. If we end up filling this, we&#8217;re not going make any profit with this project. So then one of my teammates said, let&#8217;s price in that. Let&#8217;s price in and see if they can afford it. So we literally added another zero to our pricing, literally like 5 times, 10 times. And we said like, hey, this is our minimum, do you want to go ahead?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I said, sure, like this is peanuts. And they were worried like, do you understand the project? You are quoting very less, your starting point is very less than our internal budget. So they came to our office, they were based in India. Luckily they were in the same city. They came to our office to audit us physically. They put like remarks like, you don&#8217;t have a fingerprint scanner in your biometric sensors in your office entry. There is no employee log.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we are not storing any of your data. So this office is not the building where your data will reside. Your data will reside on AWS, or all those cloud servers. And then they got convinced. WordPress was very small then, and we were the only known agencies, which was fully committed to WordPress at that point. So they didn&#8217;t have choice two, three, so they kind of crossed the fingers and gave us that project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It took six months to close. I was very pessimistic. It&#8217;s only after two, three years that we realised that they&#8217;d become our largest client by a huge margin. All my blogger friend put one side, and this single client, one side. And that revenue was growing very nicely, year on year. Renewals, they had this retainers, every year they were renewing without asking questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I realise that it&#8217;s very hard to win these big clients, but once you are in it becomes very smooth journey, henceforth, like after that point. And then I think 2014 around, after two, three years data, when I saw that this client was consistently, for the last three years in a row, our biggest client. Zero sales effort, zero account issues, no negotiation on pricing, and everything was smooth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So then I thought like we should go in to some enterprise space, and luckily around that time I had a call with Chris Lema. Chris Lema used to be available for consulting calls on Clarity. I&#8217;m not sure if that service is still around. And I still remember it was exactly 33 minutes that I talked to Chris. He repositioned rtCamp. In 33 minutes he gave me some amazing breakthrough idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And after that call, first time we told ourselves, we are enterprise WordPress agency from today. Until 2014 we were not identifying ourself or branding ourself as an enterprise workplace agency. That moment was the first time when we put in bold letters on our homepage, in SEO Meta, everywhere we added, we are enterprise, enterprise, enterprise WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:35] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Can you remember that moment? So if you cast your mind back, when you added the zero and sent it, and there was obviously some suspicion in your mind that nothing&#8217;s going to come of this or what have you. Can you remember the feeling? So it&#8217;s an odd question because I&#8217;m asking you about your feelings, but can you remember the feeling when they came back and said, oh yeah, this is not as expensive as we&#8217;d imagined? That really must have opened up an entirely new world for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:00] <strong>Rahul Bansal:</strong> Yeah. So firstly, it was very unexpected because we were selling like WordPress projects for $100, $50, $500. The biggest was $1,000. We still remember we built a complete BuddyPress plugin for $900. And we were like so happy when that client sent us $100 tip. He rounded up to $1,000 and we were partying, like with that extra $100, we throw a party to our team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And suddenly this client comes and they said, $5,000 is okay? Are you kidding me? Because they sent so much data I didn&#8217;t want to fill in, so I just thought, let&#8217;s just give them a number and they will walk away. We&#8217;ll not appear as a company who didn&#8217;t want to fulfill their data request. I thought, I will give them a reason to walk away, but then it didn&#8217;t walk out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially I was still skeptical because they really demand too much data. Just imagine, we were like some 20 people agency at that time, and we spent three to six months in back and forth sales call. We didn&#8217;t have typical sales team at that point. Writing those long answers. We were not even understanding questions. The problem was not that we didn&#8217;t want to give data or we didn&#8217;t take security seriously, there were things that we never heard of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was all like foreign language to us. What are they asking? Why do they want to do that? I was not expecting lifetime revenue, that concept was not in our books then. So it was project, money in, money out, end of email, site goes live. Then the recurring revenues hosting companies. We were not into selling maintenance contract.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it was a project kind of thinking like big, big economy mindset. So even with 5,000, I thought like, the amount of effort they&#8217;re putting us, we won&#8217;t be left with any decent margin after this project. And that was a true case. For first year there was not much margin left because they had put us through a lot of work to fulfill that project. And then we realised we underquoted after that also, because when the data, we had to talk to their Microsoft vendor. They were using Microsoft SharePoint. There were many rough edges that we had no idea could happen to us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In year one, they were the highest revenue, but project was in loss. It&#8217;s only a year, two, three, it was very good profit. And then we have the strategy that we call now land and expand. Land big accounts, no matter whatever price point you wanted to do, go aggressive, and then once you are in, then you spread within the organisation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:08] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Oh that&#8217;s an interesting insight. So land and expand. Land the client, the big fish, if you like, with the knowledge that if you maintain the relationship over many years, the profit can build up. Not necessarily year one, but maybe a bit in year two, and year three, and year four, it&#8217;s beginning to mature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, it sounds like such an interesting story. And, again, I&#8217;m going to rewind back to before 2014, so before you added enterprise to your website and have you. Do you think if you had begun your journey today, that you would have the same capability to expand in the same way? Because it feels like there are now quite a few players. Perhaps when you began that was less of the case. You were competing in a much less crowded marketplace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it feels like everybody&#8217;s intent now is to become an agency which can call itself enterprise. And I&#8217;m imagining that you got your foot in the door at a really nice time where you became a name that everybody could trust, and the recommendations come in because of prior work, but maybe that would be more difficult now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:08] <strong>Rahul Bansal:</strong> The market is much bigger now. In fact, just imagine WordPress market share. When we were building the first initial websites, there was not even custom post types that were present in WordPress. So all the WordPress plugins, we used to do a lot of hacks. There was not standardisation. So a lot of things happened with WordPress as a platform. WordPress evolved. The market share has become so big. It&#8217;s easier to sell. We have so many examples like from White House to large publishers. And globally, it&#8217;s not like just the American companies are using WordPress. India&#8217;s second largest publisher also uses WordPress. So does Al Jazeera in Qatar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there are many big websites all over the world so it makes WordPress easy to sell. The market is big. There is a precedence where you can pitch somebody, this is WordPress used by so and so. I believe that no matter which lead you are dealing with, so if you have a lead from a certain industry, a certain geography, you will find a WordPress success story in their geography. You will find WordPress being used by your prospect&#8217;s competition. That makes it easier to sell WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, yeah, the competition is more because opportunity is bigger. The pie is a lot bigger. Otherwise we would&#8217;ve stuck to the same size. Every year we are adding more people because we are able to get more work for them, even with these new agencies coming up. In fact, it&#8217;s easier to build WordPress agency, or any kind of enterprise grade agency now, because the recipe is quite clear. Because we can look at how other agencies are doing and you can take some lessons from them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At that time we had no idea. Like, in fact, we didn&#8217;t have the idea that we should position ourselves enterprise grade agency, that was the call with Chris. Before that call, we had no idea that we should be labeling ourselves as an enterprise grade agency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:42] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> If clients approach you, and it sounds like this may not be the case. It feels like people are approaching you because you build WordPress, not inquiring whether or not you would do a WordPress project for them. What are the one or two bits that you always bring out when a client says, well, why would we go with WordPress? What are the one or two top line items which you think, okay, if we&#8217;re going to build you a website, we&#8217;re going to choose WordPress, and here&#8217;s the best reasons at enterprise? So we&#8217;re not talking about a mom and pop store, that it really doesn&#8217;t matter if it goes down a bit. What are the one or two things which you bring out when an enterprise client wants to know why WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:18] <strong>Rahul Bansal:</strong> First we want to reassure them that WordPress is the right platform. So this is a difference between a product company and agency. A product has a landing page, which is more similar, it gets us to a lot of people. But an agency pitch is tailored for every client, every prospect. So our first goal is to find competition. So which are the competitors for this particular client, prospective client, and see if they&#8217;re using WordPress. If your competition is using WordPress, you will feel a lot more comfortable going after it, because nobody wants to be first, especially in large enterprises.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another way we define enterprise is that, when you are not buying from out of your pocket. In a large organisation, your job is not to save the money or find cheapest solution, your job is to deliver result so that it can go very nicely in your annual review report. I still believe people, especially in enterprise, are looking for safety as a first because they know that they have budget to build anything under the sun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So usually we say less like, WordPress can do this, WordPress can do that. Because for everything that WordPress or any platform doesn&#8217;t do out of the box, they have budget. What they need to know is that it&#8217;s secure, it&#8217;s safe, it&#8217;ll scale well. And if some government approaches us, so we show that public sovereign fund, that they&#8217;re managing. So that client has a special permission with us, like we cannot refer them publicly, that government agency, but we can refer them to other government agencies in private conversations. So that is how we convince like, okay, this is similar people to you who are using WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think safety is still the first thing that people are looking for because, it&#8217;s not even WordPress, it starts with open source. There is something, somebody did some marketing where people believe or have this misconception that open source will be easy to hack, because you can see the code, you can easily hack. That is our first step. If client mentions it explicitly, we go all in. Even if the client doesn&#8217;t mention it, if the prospect says that we are looking for rating interest, we still will verify. Are you sure that you are sorted on WordPress being safe? Any concerns, any doubts?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then features, because WordPress has no match. And I&#8217;m not saying this as a WordPress agency. The Gutenberg editor itself alone is miles apart. If you go to any other platform, the editing capabilities are nowhere close to Gutenberg editor. Gutenberg editor demo itself is a deal breaker in many cases. We just show them Gutenberg editor, and they&#8217;re like, wow, is this possible? Is this thing real? Is this some mockup? No, this is website. After the call, we are going to send you a URL, go and try your hands on. This is no fake, that vaporware demo where you see something on my screen, but in reality it doesn&#8217;t work like that. This is the real website. Go and try it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:53] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s really interesting because in the non-enterprise, that message hasn&#8217;t necessarily landed. Gutenberg is, it&#8217;s very divisive issue, isn&#8217;t it? Whether you use it or not. And it&#8217;s curious that you are saying that it&#8217;s one of the key things which leads to the success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Can you just dig into that a little bit? What are some of the aspects of Gutenberg which make the clients think, okay, this is great, this is perfect, this is just what we need? What are some of the features that you draw out of the block editor?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:19] <strong>Rahul Bansal:</strong> So I think the main difference that we feel like compared to the consumer WordPress, I would say. The consumer WordPress access technologies on very different platform, like proprietary. Just imagine somebody is using Instagram to create reels. With that mindset they come to WordPress Media Library and expect video editing experience like that to happen in WordPress, they will be disappointed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But here we&#8217;re talking to people in large companies, very large companies, using legacy systems, probably from the nineties. They might have a desktop application to update a webpage, some ugly looking forms. We even have a memory where a client, their publishing workflow they had to write an article using a very poorly designed HTML web form, and they had to upload images via FTP. And then they had to reference images in document. There was no drag and drop interface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So now if somebody like this person comes to Gutenberg, it&#8217;s like an iPhone moment for them. With that being said, Gutenberg itself is a very powerful editor. We haven&#8217;t come across a case where somebody said, oh, this is not flexible. As I said, like enterprise have a very good balance around the feature versus maintenance. For example, so Gutenberg may have one or two features less compared to a third party page builder, but then being part of Core, they&#8217;re assured that five years down the line, it will be very well maintained.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Security is more important to them because one less plugin means one less attack vector. Less things to break, less things to train, less things to maintain going forward. We as an agency develop so many sites on Gutenberg that we have our own libraries and our own patterns. So it&#8217;s like, whenever a requirement comes, we can easily map it to Gutenberg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:51] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I think that&#8217;s the difficult thing to imagine if you&#8217;ve never built your own block or you&#8217;ve never delved into patterns. But certainly at the enterprise level, if a client comes to you and said, we have this repeatable thing, and we need to put this repeatable thing on page every time. And honestly it&#8217;s real chore. And you can build a block, and they drop the block in, and now they just fill out some fields, drag an image in here, and suddenly, boom, it&#8217;s exactly on the front end what were expecting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s that kind of thing, isn&#8217;t it? It&#8217;s that, almost like an app inside of an editor. So we&#8217;ve got a block which consumes perfectly the content that you want, and we can adapt it if your needs change. But if you&#8217;ve never really gotten into that, it&#8217;s hard to imagine. It&#8217;s just a bunch of paragraphs and images, but it&#8217;s not, it&#8217;s so much more powerful than that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:34] <strong>Rahul Bansal:</strong> One thing I would say that, if you look at any large corporation, they have something called design systems, where they have their brand guidelines across products, not just websites like, across mediums like print and everywhere. With Gutenberg, it is very intuitive and easy to map the design system into WordPress. So that is where Gutenberg shines, that you can create patterns, you can create theme json. You can give them a starting point which blends very well with their existing design system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is where half of the job gets done. Like, compared to indie hackers or small businesses, large enterprises are not running after lots of plugins. They don&#8217;t want to try a hundred plus blocks plugin, a plugin with 200 blocks. They want to restrict number of choices. They want to have less number of blocks, but properly weighted with the user&#8217;s guidelines. So it&#8217;s like, the freedom they demand is easily given by Gutenberg, and with the assurance of, it is going to be around long term. It&#8217;ll be very well maintained. It&#8217;ll be very well supported, and performance. I still feel Gutenberg has much better performance, the markup, SEO qualities, top notch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:35] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I think it&#8217;s just the constraints that you can put around that editing experience. So if the client comes and they want this inexperienced user to be able to create content but have boundaries so they can, I don&#8217;t know, they can add an image here and it will be, it doesn&#8217;t matter, they just put it in and it will output perfectly. And here&#8217;s where the text goes, but they can&#8217;t change the fonts, you&#8217;re not allowed to change the color and what have you. All of those kind of constraints around the editing experience. It&#8217;s just miraculous really what&#8217;s possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think it gets lost because the majority of people, I&#8217;m imagining using WordPress are sort of tinkering with Core blocks and it can become confusing. There&#8217;s lots of choices. You try one thing and it doesn&#8217;t work out, and you throw your hands in the air. But if you&#8217;ve built the perfect thing, then all of those guardrails are in place and it will output the perfect thing every time. I think that&#8217;s really interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do you grow, and how do you find your next employees? Because I&#8217;m guessing at the level that you are now at, you must have some fairly exacting specifications when you put out a job description. And WordPress is becoming an increasingly JavaScript based thing. Lot more technical difficulties. Where do you find your talent, and is it becoming harder to find?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:40] <strong>Rahul Bansal:</strong> This would be unique to literally us. We have what we call our own training center where we, every year we take some 50 students from college, who recently graduated. Every six months we take 25 to 30 students from colleges. We put them through six months of training, like a complete, they get paid to learn WordPress for six month. They have no obligation to continue with us. They can join our competition, they can do anything with the WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we really get this talent and this job is very popular in India. So this training we run, the pay scales are very popular in India. So last year also we had some 90,000 applications for 60 positions. We literally have to build a platform. So we have a campus adding platform, its name is Chitragupta. Chitragupta is basically is responsible for managing the ledger of your good and bad work. So in Hindu mythology. So we built  Chitragupta, which basically scans your GitHub repos and assigns your grade.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And those 9,000 people gets graded. And then we interview from top to bottom until 60 positions gets filled. So last time we had to interview some 1,200 students, by the time 60 students got selected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then we put them to the six month training. Our course is public, so people know what is going to be in the course, and so we find a lot of passionate people. Many times by the time they join our course, I&#8217;ve already gone through it from the public website that we have learn.rtcamp.com. From there, they already have checked it. And then we put them through the six month training. After that, this thing we started this year only. After six month training, we put them six months into the WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So WordPress Core has a mentorship program running on for new contributors. So this year we enrolled 10 people, managed by Automattic and Google employees, senior employees. So they are mentoring this people for further. So first year we, we invest them heavily. Zero revenue, only investment in year one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then from year two, we start getting, like some client work done from them. And this is something turned out to be very great for us from last three years. At some point we felt, there are same number of people switching between agencies, and net new addition to the WordPress worker pool was getting stagnant, especially around Covid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I felt the way people used to discover life with WordPress, or a professional life with WordPress was mostly through WordCamps or meetup groups, and when that Covid happened, we suddenly missed those years, when new people didn&#8217;t come to the WordPress, as many as they used to come before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there was this gap that started hurting large agencies, like us. Because if we look at a small website, then the enterprise budget appears a lot, but there&#8217;s always a limit. No company approves unlimited budget for any venture. Like for every project there&#8217;s a budget. It&#8217;s usually large enough, but there&#8217;s always a number and, as talent was getting more expensive, WordPress was getting unaffordable at some point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I talked to some medium publishers, medium sized publishers, not the big ones, who complain a lot. Like the good WordPress agencies are either sold out or too expensive. It&#8217;s like WordPress is suddenly getting unaffordable, and that is when we started in this hiding experiment, where we onboarded people every year. And this is, we are doing from last four years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we have been hiring for many years, but early it was 5, 10 people. This massive scale of hiring we started from last three to four years. And, it turned very well for us. Like all these people in second year clocked, like in agency billable hours is a very big metric, and in second year, these people clock 90%, more than 90% billable hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:08] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s incredible. What a great idea. Can I just ask, just to clarify with that, is that an in-person thing? So you come to a place where 60 people gather, and the tuition is taking place in the same room, or is it an online thing or?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:23] <strong>Rahul Bansal:</strong> So before Covid it was, it used to be in the same room, but the scale was 20 people at that time only. After Covid, we made it completely remote. It&#8217;s now completely remote. It&#8217;s still in the same time zone because, these are the Zoom calls, recordings. The time zone synchronization is needed. So that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s currently India only. But we are expanding it to other territories, and we are seeing like if we can create similar talent pool in other part of the world. Because,early it was in n office, then it went remote over Zoom. And this year, it is going async. We have a dedicated department, which is called Learning and Development Department.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So our agency head has implemented most lessons in a synced way, so that people can wake up at different time. And so it&#8217;s like they won&#8217;t get blocked. They can learn asynchronously, they can complete this six month course asynchronously.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:11] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It just sounds like the appetite is incredible. The numbers that you just mentioned there, I think you said something like 1200 or something like that, people for 90 places. That&#8217;s just remarkable. So the appetite really is there. It seems like such a commendable project as well, in that you are putting out a limited, you know what, you can manage. 60 people out into the workplace. Some of them may end up working with you. Some may end up working with your competitors. But you&#8217;ve put 60 people out there who are really credible at pushing the boundaries of what WordPress can do, and hopefully just making a start on their career.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:44] <strong>Rahul Bansal:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:45] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> But I know that it&#8217;s not just limited to that. And, I would like to get into this just before we finish, because I think this is important. Over the last few years we see these metrics every year of companies who put time into the WordPress project in general, in a whole manner of different ways. They may be sponsoring events. They may be committing staff to Five for the Future and what have you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the company, your company, rtCamp, it always seems to be right at the forefront of that in a growing way. I&#8217;d just like to applaud you for that and give you an opportunity to say what it is that you do so that we&#8217;ve got an impression of just how much good you are doing apart from obviously, having a very profitable agency and what have you, how much good you&#8217;re putting back into the community as well. So just outline your commitments to the WordPress project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:29] <strong>Rahul Bansal:</strong> So, as I mentioned that, so we have multiple ways of contributing. So as we hire a lot of from college, unfortunately we cannot have a lot of Core committers with us, but we take care of the other end. For example, these 10 people, we have a commitmentt now internally that every six months, so we will put 10 people full-time, like full-time as in literally full-time. A hundred percent of their time will go in working on WordPress project for six months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then this will be rotated by next batch. So in rotation there will be at least 10 people. As we grow further, then we&#8217;ll make it 15, 20. And we want to keep this ramping up this number. So there will be always, WordPress Core will have enough junior people to pick the task. So, that good first issues will, somebody will be looking at them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then we have a QA people, work into the QA team, other teams. I myself as WordCamp organizer, for WordCamp Asia. We have other people contributing to different part of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have a training course, which is public domain, in public domain. We started that much before learn.wordpress.org is there. Now  learn.wordpress.org is there, it is much better resource. But then this course was there for many years, and many other agencies use it. So that is one of the way to build human capital. So this word actually drives me a lot. We want to consciously put our efforts in developing human capital of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because in the end, it&#8217;s people that do the job, no matter how fancy it is. You need a human to put a prompt to the AI. ChatGPT won&#8217;t build things on its own. You need to, you need a human to ask creative questions. And we want to ensure that WordPress economy continues to grow, and it never falls short of people. So we hire a lot of junior people. We put into the workplace. We publish our videos tutorial. We publish our training material also in the public domain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many companies use it, and we expect no link back, also, no credit. Because sometimes they have a apprehension that if they know, this is why rtCamp course will, for, example, our training course site doesn&#8217;t require registration. So if you&#8217;re sending your employees to learn WordPress on our site, we won&#8217;t track them. We won&#8217;t solicit them. We have no way of knowing who&#8217;s learning. Google Analytics just shows traffic. A lot of traffic is coming to those training sites, but we have no personally identify information tracked there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:45] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I would imagine that in every aspect of your business, except this, maybe, there&#8217;s gotta be some measurable ROI. Okay, we put this in, we get this out. Do you have any metrics to measure your commitment to the community, or is it just putting your finger in the air and thinking, okay, last year, our business did this, let&#8217;s put, I don&#8217;t know, whatever it might be. Do you have a pro forma that you stick to? A number of hours, a number of people? Or is it just, yeah, this feels right this year. Because you can&#8217;t measure this. And in some cases, I imagine people would think, yeah, they&#8217;re probably overdoing it a little bit over there and what have you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:21] <strong>Rahul Bansal:</strong> So, we have a top line mandate that, so it&#8217;s like, internally we divide engineers in three categories in rtCamp. The junior ones were like less than two years in rtCamp. The senior ones like two to five years. And lead levels were like more than five years with us. The junior one, we target 20% of their time for WordPress Core. And the medium level, the seniors, 10%, and lead level is 5%. Lead level is very hard, because we have very less lead engineers. The demand supply gap is more evident on senior and lead level. But then, these metrics are, so our office structure is that we have some called business needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So every people need to submit their 20% report. Not only they need to submit the hours report, like they have their hours went into the WordPress Core or different part. They have to compile what are the issues they solved. It&#8217;s not like you&#8217;re just making time entries. You have to tell in the leadership quarterly review that I have 50 people in my business units, and together they clock 3000 hours. And this is what we achieved in 3000 hours. And this is approved. The props messages we see in WordPress Slack, those screenshots, if our employee names is mentioned, are taken screenshots and filing into those review reports.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Three people got props from my team. The WordPress Core release notes, like with major releases. So those contributor list also presented by them. If somebody&#8217;s doing some make WordPress blog post or activity, those are also tracked by them. So the heads compile this report, from like bottom ups and then present in leadership meeting. So this is not accidental.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The material ROI is very hard to measure. We cannot say that, oh, we made like X dollars because of this effort. I think, as a salesperson, when I tell a client like, hey, I&#8217;m going to give you an engineer who knows WordPress very well. I&#8217;m more confident if that person has contributed six months to the WordPress Core. And their patches is weighted by some amazing people in WordPress community, especially senior ones. It&#8217;s like a win-win situation for all. This gives me a very, very well trained people to sell.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:16] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s exactly how I was just thinking about it. This kind of win-win cycle of you put people into WordPress, and obviously at a junior level, more time and I can understand that. That makes sense. Presumably the ones who are more experienced, they&#8217;ve got other work to be doing. But also they&#8217;ve probably gained a ton of experience doing those prior years of extra hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you put the hours in, but also they contribute to Core, but they get experience back out. They&#8217;ll be exposed to all sorts of different things that your projects would never have put them in front of, presumably. So they&#8217;ll be touching on subject matters. Getting into plugins, themes, blocks, code, Core, whatever it may be in a whole range of different ways than they would be. So like you say, it&#8217;s like you slap my back, I&#8217;ll slap yours a little bit. Win-win. WordPress wins, you win.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:43:06] <strong>Rahul Bansal:</strong> There are three wins here. The person, that student, who came right out of the college, and usually in college, people here, people have some negative perception about professional life. That companies are evil. You are going to do labor. Somebody will steal your credit, and here they&#8217;re on their own. Like they go into the WordPress community on their own. They sign a patch with their name. They file a Trac ticket with their name. They get props in their name. They get treated very well by contributor. If somebody makes mistakes, WordPress committee is full of nice people. Nobody&#8217;s going to pull them down. Nobody&#8217;s going to shout at them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everybody corrects them with respect and compassion, and that helped them grow as a person. Like, they become better human. They become better coder. And that empathy, we see that, when they become senior engineers, and when they&#8217;re reviewing some junior&#8217;s code, they remember that, hey, when I was, it was my first day in WordPress community, and I made that patch. I made one mistake, but somebody was nice to me, so I have to pass it on. So that niceness cycle continues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, the biggest win is that these people like, who has an incredible job satisfaction. They love open source more. Many of them don&#8217;t join for the love of open source, they&#8217;re at a point when they, join rtCamp, they&#8217;re at a point when their college is ending. They just want to get a job, and secure a financial life. Whatever jobs comes their way, they&#8217;re okay with it. Open source, closed source, not much preference. But once they&#8217;re in, and then we take them through this one year of tour, like six months in training center, then six months in WordPress community, they become the advocate of open source for life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that is a very most important win for us because we want people to believe in open source. We don&#8217;t want them to say open source is good because their company is selling it. We want them to have that faith that open source is the right way to do things. And that faith is very important for growth. You cannot mug up your mission statement and stand for it.. You have to believe in something to stand for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:45:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> What a profoundly interesting thing to have said. I think that&#8217;s just fabulous. I think your company is doing so many interesting things. It&#8217;s obviously, financially it&#8217;s working out, but just the position that you&#8217;ve painted there of the way that you are treating your employees, and the autonomy that you&#8217;re giving them, and the future opportunities that you are giving them. And the training opportunities giving them, just remarkable. And I&#8217;m profoundly impressed by what you&#8217;ve been doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, time is our enemy. We&#8217;re going to call it a day there. Rahul, thank you so much for chatting to me today. That has been an incredible journey. Long may it continue. I wish you and rtCamp all the success that you can possibly have the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:45:39] <strong>Rahul Bansal:</strong> Thank you, Nathan. Thanks for having me on this podcast.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rahul286/\">Rahul Bansal</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rahul is the founder and CEO of <a href=\"https://rtcamp.com/\">rtCamp</a>, a large agency that specialises in enterprise-grade WordPress projects. He began his journey quite differently, starting as an individual blogger back in 2006, discovering WordPress in 2007, and gradually transitioning from being a publisher to a freelance developer, before founding rtCamp in 2009. Today, rtCamp is an enterprise-grade WordPress consultancy agency, operating globally and trusted by clients such as Google, Meta, Automattic, NewsUK, and Al Jazeera.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rahul sheds light on working with enterprise clients in the WordPress space. Many of us are familiar with WordPress in the context of small businesses and blogging, but the enterprise space demands additional layers of security and scalability. Rahul explains the factors that set enterprise projects apart, and why meticulous code reviews, &nbsp; and security audits are essential when working at this level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He talks about the opportunities in the enterprise space, recounting how rtCamp initially stumbled into enterprise level projects, not even realising their potential until a client’s high expectations led to a decision to market themselves as an enterprise agency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also discuss the role of WordPress in enterprise environments, from why Gutenberg has become a credible selling point, due to its powerful editing capabilities, to how the platform’s flexibility supports varied enterprise needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rahul also gets into the importance of positioning, how historical context offers advantages, and the expanding market that makes WordPress a compelling choice for large clients today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards the end, we explore rtCamp’s innovative internship program aimed at growing the WordPress talent pool, and the way they are contributing back to the WordPress project; a win-win for the business and the broader community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve ever considered what it takes to work with WordPress at the enterprise level, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://rtcamp.com/\">rtCamp</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/\">White House website</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/\">Al Jazeera website</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://campus.rtcamp.com/\">Campus at rtCamp</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://learn.rtcamp.com/\">rtLearn</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:97:\"Do The Woo Community: Effective Collaboration with Clients and Teams: A Chat with Zach Hendershot\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=92561\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:95:\"https://dothewoo.io/effective-collaboration-with-clients-and-teams-a-chat-with-zach-hendershot/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:237:\"In this episode, Adam and Emma discuss effective collaboration with Zach, CEO of Miruni, focusing on setting clear expectations, minimizing manual tasks via automation, and enhancing communication for better client and team interactions.\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 09:49:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"Gravatar: Top Strategies for Reducing Friction in Sign-Ups\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"http://blog.gravatar.com/?p=2830\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:50:\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2025/03/11/sign-up-flow/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:17831:\"<p>Creating effective sign-up flows presents a challenging balance. Users expect quick, frictionless experiences, but businesses need quality data to better serve their customers. To get this information, they often overload the sign-up process, leading to high abandonment rates and lost opportunities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thankfully, there is a way to find balance – and we’re talking about more than just user-friendly designs. Advanced strategies like intelligent data collection timing and progressive disclosure techniques help maintain healthy conversion rates while gathering essential user information. These approaches, combined with AI-driven personalization, can transform a standard sign-up process into an engaging experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reducing friction while maintaining control over data collection might seem daunting. However, by implementing strategic optimization techniques and tools like Gravatar&#8217;s developer API, you can significantly reduce friction points in their sign-up process.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, let’s see how you can do just that while still collecting valuable user data that allows for personalization and improves the overall user experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Essential strategies for reducing sign-up friction</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When talking about sign-up friction, a common topic is form optimization, but that’s only the beginning. You need a bit more if you want to create better sign-up experiences and reduce drop-off rates while still maintaining high data quality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, <a href=\"https://www.newbreedrevenue.com/blog/progressive-profiling-and-how-to-use-it\"><strong>progressive profiling</strong></a><strong> allows you to collect user information gradually</strong> rather than overwhelming new users with lengthy forms like these:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"3432\" height=\"1716\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/badsignup_iag.png\" alt=\" Example of a bad sign-up form with loads of information\" class=\"wp-image-2833\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of requesting all details upfront, ask only for essential information during sign-up, and additional data can be gathered as users engage with your product.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"3433\" height=\"1716\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/goodsignup_iag.png\" alt=\"Example of progressive profiling in a sign-up\" class=\"wp-image-2834\" />\n\n\n\n<p>You can also <strong>use email-based </strong><a href=\"https://docs.gravatar.com/\"><strong>profile systems like Gravatar</strong></a><strong> to make the process even easier.</strong> By integrating Gravatar into your sign-up flow, you can automatically populate user avatars and profile information using just an email address. This eliminates several manual entry steps.</p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://docs.gravatar.com/getting-started/\"><img width=\"3242\" height=\"729\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/gravatar_integration_cta.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2632\" /></a>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Delayed email verification keeps users engaged</strong> by letting them access your app immediately after sign-up. <a href=\"https://www.chargebee.com/\">ChargeBee</a> is a great example of this approach:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>New users enter the platform right away by filling in the more important details.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1724\" height=\"1290\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/chargebee-sign-up-form.png\" alt=\"Chargebee sign-up page\" class=\"wp-image-2835\" />\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"2\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>They verify their email address only after signing in.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"374\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/chargebee-email-verification-message.png?w=660\" alt=\"Chargebee email confirmation message\" class=\"wp-image-2836\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, <strong>smart forms with predictive error prevention catch potential issues before submission</strong> rather than returning users to a form with error messages. This real-time validation helps users complete sign-up forms correctly the first time.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1302\" height=\"546\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/example-error-prevention-chargebee.png\" alt=\"Example of predictive error prevention on Chargebee’s sign-up page\" class=\"wp-image-2837\" />\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Intelligent data collection: When and what to ask&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Making smart decisions about when to request user information can significantly impact sign-up completion rates. A strategic approach starts with distinguishing between essential and non-essential data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Essential information typically includes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Email address (for account creation).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Password.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Username (if required).</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Non-essential information such as company name, last name, job title, team size, and phone number can definitely wait.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Custom triggers help time additional data requests effectively.</strong> For example, only ask for team size after users show interest in collaboration features. Or request company details when someone visits the enterprise pricing page.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"3432\" height=\"1716\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/signup_iag.png\" alt=\"Example of custom triggers for additional data\" class=\"wp-image-2838\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Profile enrichment through </strong><a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/08/26/gravatar-api-tutorial-for-app-developers/\"><strong>integrations and APIs</strong></a><strong> offers another powerful approach. </strong>By combining email-based profile services like Gravatar with progressive data collection, you can build comprehensive user profiles without overwhelming new users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravatar&#8217;s API can automatically populate non-essential information from a user&#8217;s email address, eliminating the need to ask for basic profile details during sign-up. This approach maintains high conversion rates while still gathering valuable user data.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How Gravatar simplifies user onboarding</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1504\" height=\"1050\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/profile-as-a-service-gravatar-new.png\" alt=\"Gravatar for developers – Profiles-as-a-Service homepage\" class=\"wp-image-2839\" />\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://gravatar.com/\">Gravatar</a> transforms the traditional sign-up process by automatically populating user profiles through a single email address. This approach eliminates multiple manual entry steps that often cause users to abandon sign-up forms – according to a <a href=\"https://www.wyzowl.com/customer-onboarding-statistics/\">2020 study by Wyzow</a>, 80% of users have deleted an app because they found the initial setup process too complex.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is why major platforms like <a href=\"https://github.com/\">GitHub</a>, <a href=\"https://openai.com/\">OpenAI</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/\">Atlassian</a> use Gravatar to enhance their sign-up experiences.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By implementing Gravatar&#8217;s REST API, developers can instantly access a rich set of user information:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Display names and avatars.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Professional information.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Biography and location.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Language preferences.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pronouns.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Social and professional links.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>User interests.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Work history.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Social connections.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This enriched data collection happens without requesting additional information from users during sign-up. Instead of presenting new users with lengthy forms asking for profile details, applications can pull this information automatically through the Gravatar API.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The benefits extend beyond the initial sign-up. </strong>With comprehensive profile data available immediately, applications can <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/08/16/user-experience-personalization/\">create personalized experiences</a> from the first interaction:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Customized welcome messages using the user&#8217;s name.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Interface language set to user preferences.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Content recommendations based on stated interests.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Contextual features based on professional background.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Team collaboration suggestions using work history.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Social connections through matched interests.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Location-based content and recommendations.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Implementing Gravatar also helps solve common onboarding challenges:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Reduces form abandonment by minimizing required fields.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Eliminates the need for users to upload profile pictures.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Maintains consistency across multiple platforms.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Allows users to update their information in one place.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Supports both individual and role-based personalization.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Enables automatic profile updates across integrated services.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The system respects user privacy by letting individuals control what information they share. </strong>Users can maintain multiple profiles with different levels of detail tied to separate email addresses, giving them full control over their online presence while still providing valuable data for personalization.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"331\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/verified-profiles-privacy-settings.png?w=660\" alt=\"Example of privacy settings for a Gravatar profile – toggle switch for API access\" class=\"wp-image-2840\" />\n\n\n\n<p>For developers, integration is straightforward through the <a href=\"https://docs.gravatar.com/api/profiles/rest-api/\">REST API</a>, with comprehensive documentation and support available. And since Gravatar is free for both users and developers, it offers a cost-effective way to enhance sign-up flows and improve user engagement from the start. The API&#8217;s design focuses on developer experience, making it simple to implement and maintain while providing powerful personalization capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Real-world examples: Successful Gravatar implementations</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s see how different websites use Gravatar to make signing up and getting started super simple.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/signup\">OpenAI</a> offers a perfect example of a streamlined approach:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Users sign up with their email and create a password.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"473\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/open-ai-signup-page.png?w=660\" alt=\"Creating an account on OpenAI\" class=\"wp-image-2841\" />\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"2\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Their profile picture automatically appears from Gravatar.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"391\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/open-ai-gravatar-profile-pic.png?w=660\" alt=\"Profile picture on the OpenAI website \" class=\"wp-image-2842\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>No extra steps are needed. </strong>This small touch adds a personal element to their AI platform experience right from the start.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://wordpress.com\">WordPress.com</a> takes this integration even further. When someone signs up, the platform automatically pulls in everything from their Gravatar profile – their bio, display name, social links, and even their location and interests.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"339\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/wordpresscom-gravatar-integration-info.png?w=660\" alt=\"Profile information on WordPress.com\" class=\"wp-image-2843\" />\n\n\n\n<p>This means new bloggers can jump right into writing instead of spending time filling out profile forms. Plus, any changes they make to their Gravatar profile automatically update across all their WordPress sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other popular platforms also use Gravatar in creative ways to make things easier for their users:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Developer platforms:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/\">GitHub</a> shows Gravatar avatars next to code contributions, helping developers build recognition in open-source communities.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"273\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/github-gravatar-profile-pic.png?w=660\" alt=\"Profile picture on GitHub\" class=\"wp-image-2844\" />\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/\">GitLab</a> uses Gravatar to personalize project dashboards and team features.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Collaboration tools:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.figma.com/\">Figma</a> automatically loads team member profiles to help people connect faster.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://slack.com/\">Slack</a> shows profile pictures in chat to help teammates recognize each other.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://trello.com/\">Trello</a> adds Gravatar photos to cards and boards to make project tracking more personal.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The best part? <strong>Users only need to update their info in one place – their Gravatar profile.</strong> That single update gets reflected everywhere they use these tools, making it super convenient to keep a consistent online presence.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Optimizing mobile sign-up experiences</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Making sign-ups work smoothly on mobile devices has become essential, with <a href=\"https://gs.statcounter.com/platform-market-share/desktop-mobile-tablet\">mobile traffic now exceeding 60% of all web visits</a>. But mobile users face unique challenges – smaller screens, touch interfaces, and often spotty connections. Here&#8217;s how to <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/09/03/app-onboarding/\">create a mobile-friendly sign-up</a> flow that gets results.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start with the basics: optimize every element for touch.</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Buttons need to be at least 44&#215;44 pixels, with enough spacing to prevent accidental taps.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Make forms finger-friendly by adding ample padding between fields.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Stick to readable font sizes – 16px minimum for text inputs to prevent automatic zooming.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Smart keyboard handling makes a big difference too. </strong>Set the right input types (email, tel, number) so users get appropriate keyboards. Group similar fields together to minimize keyboard switches. For example, keep all text fields together, then numeric fields.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simplify data entry by:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Enabling autofill where possible.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"330\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/rememberme_iag.png?w=660\" alt=\"Example of autofill during sign-up\" class=\"wp-image-2845\" />\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Offer social login options optimized for mobile.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"660\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/signin_iag.png?w=660\" alt=\"Example of user-friendly social media sign-up buttons on mobile devices\" class=\"wp-image-2846\" />\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Using Gravatar to auto-populate profile info from email addresses.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Adding real-time validation to catch errors early.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"355\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/example-password-instructions-during-signup.png?w=660\" alt=\"Example of real-time validation of a password\" class=\"wp-image-2847\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Break up longer forms into logical steps with clear progress indicators. </strong>Each step should fit comfortably on a mobile screen without scrolling. And remember – every field you require is another chance for users to abandon the process. Only ask for what&#8217;s absolutely necessary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, <strong>test your flow on multiple devices and screen sizes.</strong> What works on a large iPhone might be frustrating on a smaller Android phone.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Get started with Gravatar&#8217;s developer tools</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ready to streamline your sign-up process with Gravatar?

In today&#8217;s episode, we will talk about Gutenberg releases 20.2, 20.3, and 20 .4, and a little bit of WordPress 6.8 and WordCamp Asia. I&#8217;m your host, Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at the Gutenberg Times and a WordPress developer advocate working for Automattic and still recovering from my cold that I brought back from Manila.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And today, I&#8217;m happy to get to chat again, it was Jessica Lyschik, front-end developer at Greyd and also core contributor to the WordPress open source project. We both just returned from WordCamp Asia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hello, Jessica. How are you today? How is your jet lag?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik</em>: Hey, thanks for having me. I think the jet lag is, by now, done, I would say. So I&#8217;m back to the European time zone, but I also caught a bug after returning and had to take off a couple of days to get better. But by now, it&#8217;s like another week has passed. I&#8217;ve been working normally and yeah, I&#8217;m back to normal and preparing for the next event next week, which is CloudFest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: You&#8217;re going to CloudFest. Wonderful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I had to cancel my participation in CloudFest because I have a bum knee. And my doctor said, &#8220;Well, going to another congress where you run around like crazy from one thing to the next, it&#8217;s probably not conducive to your healing that bum knee.&#8221; It sucks at one point, yeah. But on the other hand, &#8220;Okay. I don&#8217;t have to travel.&#8221; It&#8217;s another&#8230; Yeah, I can concentrate on some of the work again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik</em>: And get enough sleep, which is something you do not get on conferences and stuff like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Right. Especially, CloudFest. I think every evening there is a festival or a party or something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik</em>: You can actually make it work. I do it the same on WordCamps. It&#8217;s the same for me. So it&#8217;s just when you are deciding where do you want to go, maybe not just be there as the first person and leave as the last person. But come late, leave early, and then just try to make it work for you. And it&#8217;s, of course, different for everyone. Some people are just like, they want to be everywhere and they need to go everywhere. And I&#8217;m more like, I need some breaks in between because otherwise that&#8217;s not going to work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah, I&#8217;m pretty much the same way. However, sometimes I&#8217;m just so present in the moment, in the conversation, that I can really lose track of time. And then these are people I&#8217;ve never going to see for the next year or so, or maybe two. So at least, that was at WordCamp Asia. Where you&#8217;re only going to go to that particular family reunion and almost feels like that. Once a year and you need to catch up on what happened with other people, and there were so many good things to happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">WordCamp Asia<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what are your takeaways from WordCamp Asia? Do you have anything that will say, &#8220;Okay. Yeah, that was very surprising&#8221;? Interesting. New.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik</em>: It has been my first time to the Philippines, I don&#8217;t know about you, but I think it has been a very interesting couple of days there in Manila. I did not get to see so much about Manila itself, unfortunately. The jet lag coming to Manila also hit me very hard. So the day I had planned to do something, go out somewhere did not happen. But I saw the Mall of Asia, which was like a gigantic mall where you could get your daily steps in very easily and not walk around the same circle for 10 times or something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I found very interesting was the food. I think the food was pretty good there. There was a lot of variety. We had a lot of Filipino food during the conference days, which I found pretty amazing. There&#8217;s a lot of seafood and fish in there. I&#8217;m not such a fan of seafood, but I tried the other things and they were all pretty good. So, I did not have anything that I didn&#8217;t like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. I was really&#8230; Not surprised, but it was quite unusual that the vegetarian as well as the vegan options are so particularly tasteful and very&#8230; I have a big variety there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> That&#8217;s true.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And I got to chat with Dan, who is a former chef, who was on the organizing team and responsible for all the food. And he just has such a passion for the Filipino food and knows everybody in Manila to pick the right caterer for the events. It was really interesting, yeah. I also got to talk with a lot of Automatticians, but they all had the same T-shirt on, so all of a sudden, I was recognizing my fellow, my coworkers. And we don&#8217;t get to see each other during the year, especially in other teams so much. So, it was really interesting for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I like to hang out at the Do The Woo. Bob had&#8230; I think he started that last year in WordCamp Europe, that he is actually a sponsor and has a spot in the sponsor hall where people can hang out. And he invites his cohorts to spend an hour there. Or other people that he collaborates with, to just spend an hour there. So they can also say to their friends, &#8220;Okay. If you want to talk to me, I&#8217;m at that hour, at the Do The Woo booth.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Oh, nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> But that was an interesting experience, yeah. So, I did that. And I was surprised how many people are actually in my talk because the such a niche topic which was about Playground and how to create demos with blueprints. And being the last session before Matt&#8217;s keynote and Q&amp;A, I thought maybe they&#8217;re not going to be a whole lot of people in that talk, but I was surprised. There were, at least, 50 or 60 people there. Yeah, it was cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik: </em>Yeah. Well, that&#8217;s nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> I was there too, I have to say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> I was at the very far back. Yeah, but it was quite interesting to go back and see, &#8220;Okay, this is&#8230;&#8221; I already know what blueprints are so it&#8217;s not that big of a deal, but going into the details again, it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh yeah, I remember that. Oh, I forgot this. Oh, okay.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, it was a very good thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> That was good. Yeah, good. So it was something for beginners, for the intermediate, and for the advanced. I was hoping about that. We will have WordCamp Europe.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, I&#8217;m not saying that. It&#8217;s not out yet. But yeah, announcements will come.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik</em>: Nice. I had a pretty good Speed Build as well with Nick, and that was a lot of fun. Nick tried to tackle the website with AI, or at least the top part with the slider with AI. Unfortunately, people said I won. I think Nick also did a great job. I felt a bit sad. Everyone&#8217;s clapping for me and cheering for me more than for Nick. It was like a bit disappointing. It&#8217;s like he tried. I would&#8217;ve never tried this with AI because I do not have the patience in 30 minutes to create something with AI. So I decided just to go, &#8220;Okay, do it in normal stuff. Just build some blocks, build some patterns there and do it.&#8221; But it was a lot of fun and it was great to see that afterwards, Nick also tried to not fix it, but further enhance it to make it an actual usable block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was pretty cool to see. He showed me the demo the next day. That was very nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And I think he blogged about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Yes, he did.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> So, I&#8217;m going to share that link in the show notes when I find it fast. Yes, Speed Build Carousel Block. Because people are always asking for carousel blocks. Why isn&#8217;t that in community, I say. I&#8217;m going to put it in a community contributions. You&#8217;ll find it in show notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the two of you saying, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;ll go back to what I know, what is fast, and what I know how to accomplish.&#8221; And then the other approach was that, &#8220;Well, let&#8217;s, under pressure, do something new.&#8221; But it&#8217;s also the, how do you approach learning new things? And sometimes you say, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m not going to learn it because I need to get my stuff done, and I know how to do this and I get it done.&#8221; When you learn new things, your task becomes more as an inspiration rather than the success because you might not end up accomplishing your task with the new thing. Because of course you are in a learning mode, you need to learn a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I compare that with my first experience with the spreadsheet on the computer, MultiPlan was that. So I&#8217;m dating myself, but yeah, it was in the early &#8217;90s. MultiPlan was even ahead of Excel from Microsoft. I had a big spreadsheet from the accountant and I said, &#8220;Oh, that should be much easier to be done in a spreadsheet on a computer.&#8221; So I spent all day, or all night actually, learning how to do this and put the spreadsheet in. But of course, it took me 6 or 8 hours. And if I would&#8217;ve done it just with a calculator, I would&#8217;ve calculated the whole spreadsheet probably in two hours or something like that. So, it&#8217;s not how long it takes to do something the first time when you learn this. It&#8217;s how long it takes when you do it a second time, because you need to discard the first time most of the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I found that a lot of people who learn block development, what took me a half an hour with short code took me three days in doing it as a block. I said, &#8220;Yeah, that&#8217;s the first time you learn of things. Of course, it takes longer. Of course, it takes&#8230; You&#8217;re all going to changing your brain into the new paradigm. But how long does it take the second time around? Is it faster or is it better?&#8221; Anyway, this is the philosophical Birgit in a horsey voice. Let&#8217;s go back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So WordCamp Asia, it was the first time for me in the Manila, and I actually planned a couple of days. Not a couple, a few days. Four days. Did some sightseeing, so I went to the historic sites of the Spanish occupation. I saw the monument for the atrocities that happened in the Second World War, and I learned about the current contemporary arts in two art museums. And I went downtown to the new business district there with a nice park and shops left and right on the street. It&#8217;s a pedestrian area. It&#8217;s beautifully done. And I also discovered a few street art that were purposefully put on that place as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, that was quite interesting. Of course, I overdid it and I got my bum knee from there. So yeah, it was a little painful than going on the conference and going in the&#8230; The venue was quite vast, I found.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> You had to walk a lot?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, you had to walk a lot. But I found all the escalators, so that was good. I didn&#8217;t have to do stairs so much. But yeah, it was a walk a lot. I like the Automattic booth was really big, but there was other&#8230; Hostinger was really big out of the usual. I also saw Mark Westguard of this WS Forms. He is on every flagship and shows off his plugin. I have to think really hard to get back to that because there&#8217;s the whole week, two weeks after that that already took over my life.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Community Contributions<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Which brings us back to, &#8220;Okay, let&#8217;s record that rest of the show.&#8221; So, we had a few releases. So on the developer blog, Robert Meszaros published an article on customizing WordPress embeds to match your theme. And I think that&#8217;s very interesting to an approach to make sure that all the embeds that you use are actually matching your theme and you don&#8217;t use it out of the box. So he has some nice examples in there, and some great code snippets in how to do all of that. It&#8217;s definitely something to go back to, to make a better theme or a better site view for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Yeah, I think it&#8217;s a nice finishing touch when you&#8217;re creating a new website that really embraces embeds. I didn&#8217;t know about this, to be honest. I just saw it today. And I think it&#8217;s really great. It&#8217;s not something super big, but when you have a brand new website and have put so many thoughts and hours into the design, and then there comes this embed that just looks like it&#8217;s not meant to be on this website, then I think this is a great example of how tweaking the sites essentially can make an embed also look like it&#8217;s part of the website and not just some part of default WordPress that just pops up somewhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, that hasn&#8217;t gotten a whole lot of love.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Yeah, that&#8217;s true.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So, he shared this. For instance, one example is that out of the box, the featured image of a post that you embed has some border around, and he just shows you how to make that image go all the way to the corners. That&#8217;s such a small little detail, but it shows the attention to detail. And when you have all your cards that you have, your postcards in the query loop all having the same design, and all of a sudden, the embed doesn&#8217;t&#8230; It really stands out. It doesn&#8217;t&#8230; And it also distracts the reader from, &#8220;Why is this different? What I haven&#8217;t seen yet?&#8221; It has some nice little features on how to change things. Some great sailing pictures here. So, take a look at that and spruce up your site with some of the little things and big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s Released &#8211; Gutenberg 20.2<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. So now, we come to Gutenberg 20.2 that was released in January, to be exact.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> End of January, I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Do you want to start out with what we are talking about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Yeah. So, this was one of the two. I think I did the Gutenberg blog post on this one. So yeah, this wasn&#8217;t such a big release. It was rather small compared to the previous ones. Also, it was combined with, I think, 21.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> 21, yep. And we talked about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> 20.1 release? Yeah. So, there isn&#8217;t that much going on in this release. It&#8217;s rather smaller bug fixes and some polishing overall. And I think one of the interesting things was that in the post content, you can now define the heading colors on a more global level. I think this was also a highlight from my blog post when I remember correctly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Mm-hmm. Yeah, I really like that you can now have the details block be more like an accordion with a name attribute. So it&#8217;s not in the UI, but you can do it in the&#8230; It&#8217;s in the UI, but you have to go to the advanced section to give all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Oh, okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, to give it all. To get this all done. It&#8217;s not for someone who doesn&#8217;t know what to do, that kind of thing. It&#8217;s not intuitive for site builders, so you need to give it a block name so it shows up as a summary. A block name about a name attribute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Oh. So, when you give it the name.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Sorry. Yeah, you need to give it a name attribute in the advanced section so the CSS that is built knows, &#8220;Okay. This is all one section. And one is open, the other ones are closed.&#8221; So, it kind of has accordion package.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> So they all need to have the same name in this name tag, so then it automatically brings this only one of these sections is open. Okay, got it. Apparently, I missed that one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Well, great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> But it&#8217;s okay. Now, we talked about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Right. Yeah, that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re here for. Two eyes see more than one. Four eyes see more than two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Definitely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I also wanted to point out that the WP env local development tool now has WP-MyAdmin support as well as Multisite support. It had it before, but now it&#8217;s also documented so you know how to use it. That&#8217;s why I wanted to point it out because…</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Documentation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Oh, I didn&#8217;t know it had this. You had this phpMyAdmin in the WP env.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> I&#8217;m not using PHP. We are so confused. I&#8217;m not using WP nth Multi&#8230; Multisite or WP env fit-all?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> WP env.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Ah, okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. It&#8217;s when you&#8217;re working on Gutenberg, on your Gutenberg, something you can do. Just WP nth and it spins up a local WordPress instance with that particular folder. It also supports Multisite that came with 20.8.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, you&#8217;re right. There were quite a few bug fixes in there and some polish in terms of previews. And also, some panel changes that have been in the last few Gutenberg releases, and also for the ones for the next. That&#8217;s a refactor of things. It was 20.2. I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> It&#8217;s a bit tricky with the numbers of 20.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah. God.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik: </em>&#8230; in the brains of WordPress people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. So that brings us to 20.3, which was released just two weeks ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gutenberg 20.3</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik</em>: We were all hanging out in Manila.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Well, it was actually before or right on February 18th and it was released. Yes, we were all hanging out already. On travel, on planes. Yeah, my plane was&#8230; I was&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> On planes, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> So, it was 12 hours to Singapore and then there&#8217;s another 3 1/2 hours from Singapore to Manila.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Oh, I did the same route.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> It was kind of 15 hours flight, but then you have to be 2 or 3 hours earlier at the airport. You have a layover in Singapore, and then you have to transfer from the airport to the hotel and&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Yeah. I think I calculated something, like 23, 24-ish hours door to door, so it&#8217;s not just like a 15 hour flight. But yeah, you have to count in all the waiting time. I had to travel to Munich airport two hours, so that all adds up to this whole ordeal of&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Traveling to Asia is easy. No, it&#8217;s not.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Enhancements</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> No, it&#8217;s not. Yeah. So Gutenberg 20.3 also has a not particular big features coming in, but some nice additions. And one of them is that the social links now of a Discord logo that you can add to it. The query block now, that is really nice. It has an option to ignore sticky post. It took a while to get the sticky post into the filter, but then there&#8217;s also the need that sometimes you need a query loop that ignores the sticky post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Yeah. It&#8217;s definitely something that you&#8217;re used to this when you&#8217;re doing classic themes and just have all the opportunity with the WP query nth function. And it&#8217;s great to see that these little things and&#8230; Even if you do not use them that often, that these are still now available. That just makes transitioning to block themes and block inside it are so much better because you finally have all the options. But maybe not all yet for the query loop, but we are getting there. Let&#8217;s put it like that. We are getting there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> For sure, yeah. There was a major push in that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you want to take the next one?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> The yet another one of completing the options that you have on block is the RSS block got border and spacing support. And also, duotone settings got improved, they now have a reset button and improved toggle rendering. Let&#8217;s have a look what this does.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, the reset button has gotten quite the attention now that it was missing on a few of those color pickers or so, or panels. So, what did you find out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Oh. I think it&#8217;s also, these are such tiny changes. But once you have them, you realize it&#8217;s so much easier to clear colors or remove something that you would have needed another four clicks or something, and then it&#8217;s just one. So it doesn&#8217;t seem like big things, but it slowly improves over time. And I think this is what the editors actually need right now, this refinement. Because there&#8217;s always been in the past pushing big projects, new features, and now it&#8217;s more like, &#8220;Okay, we are in the situation, but the best we can do is basically to do the housekeeping and fix the smaller things and polish it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack: Yeah, and the smaller things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it&#8217;s for the user. Very important to have a consistent interface. So, if you put a background color in and you have a reset button, why don&#8217;t you have a reset button on the shadows? So, shadow panel. Or why can&#8217;t I have a reset button on the text color, for instance, if it was missing. So it&#8217;s definitely, you cannot take that cognitive load. You lower that quite a bit by having an inconsistent interface. Also, with border and spacing support, if the block doesn&#8217;t have it and all of a sudden it doesn&#8217;t match what you want, then you go over looking for things. And the spacer block is not always the best solution for things. It&#8217;s not a bad solution, but it&#8217;s not the best because once a panel gets or a block gets spacing support, now you have to chase down all the spacer blocks to take them out. So, it&#8217;s kind of interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> That&#8217;s true, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> The next one is there was a bug fix or maybe a revert on the quick inserter, that it didn&#8217;t search the patterns anymore when you put a search parameter in there. And that has been restored. So I think although that&#8217;s bug fix, or I think it&#8217;s bug fix, it&#8217;s definitely worth pointing out. So, a missing feature comes back. Yay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> We just talked about it having the same options on blocks. Like, archives and categories got the color support. So, you can now have select colors on the archives and category blocks. Yet another one of those because then, people try.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you do not have them, it&#8217;s like, what do these blocks do not have? Why can I not change the color there? Then, people go to CSS and then it&#8217;s not needed actually if these settings would just be provided right from the start. But yeah, it&#8217;s like a living project. So, here we are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Or what I always did when I didn&#8217;t have color support, I put it in a group block, and then of course it blows up the nesting of my blocks. So there are always ways around it, but once things then come into the editor, you need to think about how your workaround needs to be worked around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I think those were the few things that I wanted to point out. Did you see anything else that you wanted to point out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> No, I don&#8217;t think so, but I&#8217;ve been just scrolling through it. It&#8217;s been a good chunk of bug fixes, some accessibility improvements, some performance improvements, good quality tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gutenberg 20.4</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> All right. That brings us to Gutenberg 20.4, which is also the last Gutenberg release for which the enhancements made it into 6.8. After that, it&#8217;s all bug fixes that go into the release, and any new enhancements coming into Gutenberg will be reserved for the next release. What is it? 6.9? We don&#8217;t know yet when that&#8217;s going to be, but&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what&#8217;s in there? There is a conditional enable the new default rendering mode for pages. I highlighted that. And I heard from quite a few people that they like that there is a default rendering mode for pages, but I have not seen yet the use case for it. So, why are people so excited about this? But yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> That&#8217;s a very good question. You already had this show template. That&#8217;s already in there. That&#8217;s a good question. Why it&#8217;s so hyped? Maybe, I need to test it out. That&#8217;s probably a problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I haven&#8217;t gotten to looking at the latest releases on an actual site yet because WordCamp Asia, being sick, being busy at work, life happens. I only heard this week, things were a bit off, and template parts were actually missing from if you had 6.8 Beta 1 running. So there have been some hiccups there as well,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. We definitely need to track that down here. So now, there is a persistence. So you could have a show template preferences, but now there are also sport, which is pretty cool. There was a time where you started with a new page, and first you saw all the patterns that are labeled for new pages, page layouts. That modal was removed, and now it&#8217;s back. So, it&#8217;s a 50/50 thing what people want and what don&#8217;t want when they use that. So, that&#8217;s also an interesting development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> I mean, the problem with the modal&#8230; I mean, it wasn&#8217;t removed. There was an option, because I worked on this part as well. It got an option to be disabled in the settings when you&#8217;re on a site where you have to add new pages over and over again, and you know what you want to put on a page. You do not need this modal popping up every time. So, it was more of a user enhancement so that you can decide, &#8220;Okay, do I need this model every time or do I just turn it off?&#8221; So, there was that part.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not aware if it&#8217;s back yet. I heard people saying to remove it completely. But yeah, there&#8217;s a lot of different use cases how you would like to&#8230; Some people want the model always to be on because they don&#8217;t know what they are doing, basically. They just want to pop on a template or a pattern there and are good to go. And there are people who would like to just start writing first. There are people who maybe, want to use it but don&#8217;t want to be bothered all the time. It&#8217;s one of these things where a lot of different use cases clash together, and then it&#8217;s just so hard to actually find what is it, where is the&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> The middle ground there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> What&#8217;s the thing? Where&#8217;s the middle ground that we can go and implement it that way? So, kind of everyone or the majority of people is okay with it. There will always be people who are like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t like this. I want it to be different.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> But that&#8217;s basically impossible to make it happen for everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Right, yeah. Another problem was when you say, &#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t want the starter modal,&#8221; it was hard to get the layouts, if you wanted, to get to patterns and get the layouts because there was no category for that. So, you had to assemble them from a list of patterns or from multiple pattern categories to put those page layouts together. And I think&#8230; I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s here or it was in an earlier version where they restored or created a category for patterns for the starter content. I think that was part of that, or how can we do that better for our users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there is now a pop-over on the left-hand side to show post template. If there is one to give you additional options, I think there. The next thing is that pull quote finally has the assignment styles that was missing for a long time. That you couldn&#8217;t do left, right and all of that, or wide. So, it has it now. It&#8217;s all about persistence. And border control got the reset button.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Yes. It&#8217;s, again, these tiny things that make or break something, or your experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Bug Fixes</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Right. And post comments count also have received border support. That&#8217;s cool. So now, you can have it stand out some more. Post formats have still be a little bit of a hit-and-miss with the block themes, but sometimes somebody says, &#8220;Okay, well let&#8217;s fix that some of the things.&#8221; And now, you see title and description for post formats in your templates. So in the list of templates, you can now see which are the templates for your image formats, for your link format, and if they are templates for that. So, that&#8217;s really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there&#8217;s an interesting bug fix that drove me nuts for a while, was that the text and color picker were overlapping each other in the format library. And that is fixed, thank God. Thank you so much.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Documentation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And then there are some documents updates. There&#8217;s obviously, the problem that a lot of features come in and the documentation hasn&#8217;t been updated. So, that has been rectified for the block variations using get_block_type_variationblock. And then also, removes the nodes for block hooks that it only supports static theme elements because that&#8217;s not true anymore. Block hooks also support dynamic blocks. All right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Yeah, nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> So, that was that for 20.4. That was just released this week, and we are recording this on March 7th. Just to say that.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s in Active Development &amp; Discussed &#8211; WordPress 6.8 Beta<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what&#8217;s an active development? And discussion brings us to WordPress 6.8 in Beta has been released. Beta 1 has been released. And you can follow along on the WordPress.org announcements or news. So, there will be Beta 1, Beta 2, Beta 3 and Release Candidate 1, 2, and 3 before the final release on April 15th. The test team has published, for the last few releases, always a Help Test, the next release. And this one is not different. There&#8217;s Help Test WordPress 6.8, and it helps&#8230; Well, you can help making this release the best that it can be. Finding all the bugs, not all of it, but report them. Find as much many. Try to break it as often as you can. Report the bugs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I have found another incentive on, actually, heeding to the call for testing is to learn more about the new features because instructions are very well done, compliments to Krupa Nanda, to learn more about the new features or the enhancements and how are they supposed to work so you can distinguish them. So, is it me that I don&#8217;t know how this works? That I don&#8217;t get it? Or is that a bug? So, they went to great lengths to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also use Playground to test things. You don&#8217;t have to spin up a new WordPress staging site or something like that to test things. Yeah, you can go to make.wordpress.org/test to find the post or you look for the show notes on the Gutenberg Times and click on that link.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So Jessica, the WordPress 6.8 is characterized as a polished release. Is there anything that stands out for you coming to 6.8 that you&#8217;re excited about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik</em>: I do. It&#8217;s a polishing that I think is&#8230; I mean, as I said before, given the situation that we are in, I think this is the best that we can do. And yeah, I&#8217;ve been just scrolling through these Call for Testing blog posts that you just mentioned. And it is really thoroughly, so I would actually be excited to dive into this and do the testing because this is pretty well done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think about 6.8 and the coming releases&#8230; I haven&#8217;t been paying too much attention to what is in 6.8 apart from a few things that we highlighted today, and I have probably forgotten again because I was just out of the office for two weeks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Speculative Loading in 6.8</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I think what&#8217;s also interesting is this speculative loading thing. I think there was also just a blog post these days. So, this speculative loading is, when I understood correctly, something like a browser? Like, the browser offers this API and WordPress has added its performance improvements. The performance team will probably come after me if I do not say this correctly. But from what I understood, it&#8217;s improving overall performance of a WordPress website by using these speculation rules. So it&#8217;s about what can be prefetched or what makes sense to be prefetched next, so that when you actually click on a link on the website, it loads faster because it already knows what I have, what the browser has to load in this case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think this is something very interesting that might be bumping up the performance of a few websites. So, that will be interesting to see what the actual impact will be once 6.8 is out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, I&#8217;m excited about that too. I think the browsers are now pretty well caught up with that. Not all browsers have all the features all the time, but this is something that, I think, has a big footprint around all the browsers being Firefox, Safari, Google Chrome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I link in the show notes too, Felix Arntz has published&#8230; Has worked on this feature, in the feature plugin before. And now, it&#8217;s coming to 6.8 and the dev note has been published now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik</em>: I just checked on Can I Use, and it&#8217;s actually Safari and Firefox do not support it at the moment. Chrome, Edge, and Opera do. So, there is still a bit of a&#8230; It&#8217;s not a hundred percent on all browsers, but a good chunk of browsers already support this. So I hope these other browsers, Safari and Firefox, will catch up on this because it sounds pretty promising from a performance point of view to use these speculation rules.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> I keep scrolling through the dev notes that have been published. They&#8217;re not in bulk coming out until Release Candidate 1, but John Blackburn also published a dev notes about the new encryption for the password hashing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Oh. Yes, I forgot this one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Which there&#8217;s not a whole lot of things for users to do or even for developers. It&#8217;s just to know that the passwords are now hashed differently and increase the security of any of the passwords quite exponentially, which is really good. So, thank you for Felix and John to publish the dev notes early for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right, I&#8217;m sure we are going to talk about WordPress 6.8 some more on our next show when we know a little bit more what&#8217;s in there and what&#8217;s not in there. Thank you so much, Jessica, for being here. As always, the show notes will be published on <a href=\"http://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast\">GutenbergTimes.com/podcast</a>. This is episode 115. And if you have questions and suggestions, just send them to <a href=\"mailto:Changelog@GutenbergTimes.com\">Changelog@GutenbergTimes.com</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now, a plea for all those who use Spotify for their podcast pleasure, you can leave comments there. And also, check some of the stars so people know what they can expect on the show when they discover that on Spotify. Shopify. Well, yeah. So, thanks for listening and goodbye until the next time. Thank you, Jessica.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Thank you.

When you dig deeper, if your site actually gets hacked they&#8217;ll hit you with remediation fees that can go from hundreds to thousands of dollars.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They may try to sell you a security plan that <a href=\"https://www.godaddy.com/web-security/website-security\">for example at Godaddy goes from $300 to $700 a year on top of your hosting</a>. (Don&#8217;t be fooled by the low entry price, look at renewal.) It&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/webhosting/comments/16yqtsj/my_websites_has_been_hacked_malwares_has_been/\">heartbreaking to hear stories</a> of non-technical people forced into these high fees to fix something their host should have prevented in the first place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When a host is powered by <a href=\"https://wp.cloud/\">WP.cloud</a>, it doesn&#8217;t need to do this because hacks are so incredibly rare. (That&#8217;s why it may appear more expensive, but the total cost of ownership or being a WP.cloud-powered host is much lower when you factor in human time.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One problem we&#8217;ve had on <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/\">WordPress.com</a> is we do all these amazing things and don&#8217;t tell anyone about it, something we&#8217;re trying to change with our focus this year on developers and developer tooling. One great example is <strong>we&#8217;re so confident about our security, if your site gets hacked we&#8217;ll fix it for free! </strong>We&#8217;ve actually been doing this for the better part of a decade, just never mentioned it anywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://pressable.com/\">Pressable</a> (which is WP.cloud-powered) does a better job talking about these things and <a href=\"https://pressable.com/features/manage/wordpress-hack-recovery-assistance/\">has a nice landing page on malware cleaning and hack recovery</a> that says essentially the same thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress has done a ton over the years to move the hosting industry around upgrading PHP and MySQL, PHP extensions, free SSL, and in general using our clout to advocate for user rights and freedoms from even the largest hosting companies, and I&#8217;m proud to say there are a good number, for example the ones you see at WordCamps, that have not just embraced these values but actually been more commercially successful as they&#8217;ve done so. I hope security and auto-upgrades not just for core but for plugins and themes becomes the next standard. (<a href=\"https://jetpack.com/features/security/automatic-plugin-updates/\">Jetpack does this</a> for free, <a href=\"https://cloudup.com/cdrjMTE6nfa\">some hosts charge $100/yr per site</a>.)</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 08 Mar 2025 11:07:49 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:119:\"Gutenberg Times: WordPress 6.8, Studio updates, Customize Embeds,  and other Theme Design notes — Weekend Edition 320\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?p=37892\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:122:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/wordpress-6-8-studio-updates-customize-embeds-and-other-theme-design-notes-weekend-edition-320/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22780:\"<p>Hi there, </p>\n\n\n\n<p> That was quite a long pause in February.

This blog post explains how to create custom Gutenberg blocks, covering everything from setting up your development environment to debugging block code. It starts by detailing what Gutenberg blocks are and the requirements, such as having a local WordPress installation and knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, PHP, and WordPress plugin development.<br />To make a custom block, it suggests using the <code>create-block</code> tool to set up a new plugin and explains the necessary file structure, including <code>build/</code>, <code>src/</code>, <code>edit.js</code>, <code>save.js</code>, and <code>block.json</code>. The post guides you through installing the block plugin and automating the build process with <code>npm start</code>, highlighting the functions of <code>Edit</code> and <code>Save</code> and using the <code>RichText</code> component for user interaction.<br />It also covers customization options like adding support for color and spacing, setting default properties in <code>block.json</code>, and creating nested blocks with the <code>InnerBlocks</code> component. Lastly, it touches on internationalization (i18n) using the <code>__()</code> function and provides an example of a testimonials block to demonstrate these ideas. However, it misses discussing when to use different tools, such as block styles or variations, before creating a Custom Block.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p>A new version of the local development tool, <strong>Studio</strong>, was released: <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/blog/2025/02/24/studio-preview-sites/\"><strong>Introducing Preview Sites: Pushing the Limits of Collaboration with Studio</strong></a>.

Hello James.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:50] <strong>James Kemp:</strong> Hello, how are you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:51] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, good. Nice to speak to you. James is on the podcast today to talk all things WooCommerce. And he really is a very, very credible person to talk about WooCommerce, because James is the Core Product Lead for WooCommerce over at Automattic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, when I say that title, James, I don&#8217;t really know what it means. Will you just enlighten us? And also, if you feel like throwing some other biographical information at us about your history with WordPress and things like that, feel free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:17] <strong>James Kemp:</strong> Of course. Yeah, I mean, we&#8217;ve spoken a couple of times on a podcast like this. I don&#8217;t know if we&#8217;ve done the Tavern one before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But yeah, as a quick introduction, I started using WordPress in 2009, and I started building with WooCommerce in 2011. And from that time I worked with customers and specifically like building websites for customers who needed websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in that time I built up a collection of plugins, which I sold on a premium basis, which eventually turned into IconicWP, which was a WooCommerce plugin shop with 14 or 15 premium plugins. Sold that, well, that was acquired in 2021 by Liquid Web, Stellar. And I stayed there for a couple of years, carried on working. My whole team came over with the acquisition. We carried on just working as we were really, but under this kind of bigger brand of products and WordPress software, which was quite nice. It was nice to kind of get that experience from companies selling products like we were, but they were at a much bigger scale than we were at the time. That was a nice experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, yeah, towards the end of that, I reached out to Paul, who was the CEO, at the time, of WooCommerce, and just kind of said, I feel like I could have a good impact on WooCommerce itself, is there anything there for me? And I was kind of open to whatever that might look like. There was no job description that I applied for. I just kind of reached out and said, this is what I want to do, this is what, I like doing, this is what I&#8217;m good at. And then, yeah, here we are just over a year since I joined.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I joined as a product manager. And like you say, now I&#8217;m a Core Product Manager, which is a new role within WooCommerce. So a Product Manager would be, and for context, there&#8217;s eight or nine Product Managers within WooCommerce. When I joined, we each kind of had an area of focus. So my area was order management. So any project or improvement or just, my day to day would be looking at order management and, how can we make this better? It kind of shifted outside of that a bit as well into other areas. But each Product Manager has that kind of role where they&#8217;re focused on one kind of key area of WooCommerce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there was never really any product manager that had an overall vision of the whole product. And that&#8217;s what the Core Product Manager role is. So I&#8217;m less focused on one specific area, and more focused on just, how can we make the whole thing better? And part of that role is kind of connecting the dots a bit. One team&#8217;s working on this, another team&#8217;s working on that, how do they overlap? But also connecting the community dots to the stuff that we actually put out there. So, what are people asking for? What are the common kind of requests that people have, or the complaints that people have? Or even the positives that people have and, how can we make those things better?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So is there just one of you? So there&#8217;s one Core Product Lead. There&#8217;s not multiple of those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:18] <strong>James Kemp:</strong> Correct.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:18] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Oh gosh, that&#8217;s really interesting. So you&#8217;ve got like the 10,000 mile high view of the entire project. And so you are kind of open to suggestions, innovations, improvements, tweaks, that all comes under the purview of your job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:32] <strong>James Kemp:</strong> Correct, yeah. There&#8217;s different areas. There&#8217;s what we call product, which is kind of the user facing experience. And by user I mean merchant, and probably customer as well, so the visual aspects of the product that people interact with. And then there&#8217;s the platform side of things, which are backend architecture and performance and all those kinds of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;m primarily focused on the front end aspect, not front end but, you know, the core experience we call it. I am actually focused a lot on the platform side of things at the moment as well, because the person who usually does that is on sabbatical, so I&#8217;m kind of helping out a bit there. And it&#8217;s quite nice to have, you know, that understanding as well, for approaching core experience type things. And it also encompasses the WooCommerce app and many of our premium extensions, many of our marketplace extensions, premium or free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:22] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I&#8217;m guessing that if you ask anybody the question, is their inbox pretty full? You know, the to-do list that you have is pretty full, everybody would probably say, yeah, I&#8217;ve got plenty on my plate. But it sounds as if you may well have a lot on your plate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s a lot that you&#8217;ve got to deal with in there, and you&#8217;ve got a lot of ideas, and innovations that you&#8217;d like to push forward. But is it fair to say that there&#8217;s a ton of innovation still to be done inside of WooCommerce?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:46] <strong>James Kemp:</strong> Yeah, for sure. It&#8217;s something that I&#8217;m still trying to figure out. Like, how do you stay on top of all of these things and, where is my input within this most valuable? Because I&#8217;m still working alongside all the other product managers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And actually that&#8217;s been really nice to kind of connect with a product manager that&#8217;s working on something specific, and work with them to make that the best it can be for WooCommerce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But yeah, I&#8217;m still trying to figure out how to like organise all of these things so they&#8217;re not just in my head, but they&#8217;re out there in a manageable way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:18] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> How do you get intelligence about what needs to be done? I mean, obviously there&#8217;s the team within Automattic that you deal directly with, I would&#8217;ve thought of, but do you keep your door of your office kind of half open a little bit? Are you prepared to listen to community suggestions?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And again, I&#8217;m not trying to get you to give out your email address or anything, but is there that element still? Do you still listen to people out in the community, users, and what have you? Do they come directly to you, or is there some kind of filtration process which people have to go through in order to get ideas in your head?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:46] <strong>James Kemp:</strong> There&#8217;s many ways. Yeah, I think one of the things that I love most is talking to the people that actually use it. And I do that primarily on X or Twitter. I talk to a lot of people over there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The downside to that is the majority of them are agencies and developers. It&#8217;s not a downside, the downside being that I don&#8217;t get that kind of open communication necessarily with merchants directly. So if I want to talk to a merchant that&#8217;s more of a filtered, as you say, it&#8217;s an intentional, you know, I have to reach out to a merchant and schedule a call and all that kind of stuff. There is the occasional merchant on X, but it&#8217;s not their stomping ground.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yeah, I&#8217;m also in the Slack, the WooCommerce community Slack. Some of what I&#8217;ve implemented is these kind of external channels within our own Slack. So one example of that is a project we&#8217;re working on for fulfillment statuses, where I got Becca from Kestrel WP and Patrick Garman from Minesize into one of our internal Slack rooms to discuss and kind of help shape this project. So they&#8217;re directly involved in that way in stuff that we&#8217;re working on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think something that we really want to do is be really transparent with like, this is what we&#8217;re working on. You may well have seen over the course of the last year or so that that has been the case, via GitHub discussions, via the Developer Blog, via Slack, the community Slack. But yeah, I love getting feedback from people on Twitter. I still don&#8217;t know what to call it, Twitter or X.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:18] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I often wonder if the sort of inside baseball of WordPress is a little bit hard to penetrate, because I&#8217;m imagining there&#8217;s a lot of people who use WordPress that in a million years have never opened up the WordPress Slack, GitHub is not a thing for them. And I&#8217;ve always wondered how people such as yourself, you know, in senior positions get that information. How does it get to you? And X, Bluesky, whatever the alternative is, that&#8217;s a really interesting way of kind of completely circumventing that process. I will make sure that your profile, your X profile is linked in here and then people can reach out on that basis. Yeah, that&#8217;s great. Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s just paint the picture of Woo, and how big it is because we keep hearing the statistic. The one that everybody talks about is this 43%, which is the WordPress statistic. And I never quite know how to manage that in my head, what that exactly means. But a fairly sizable number is also the e-commerce side, the WooCommerce side of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where are we at in terms of the web, and in terms of WordPress, how much of WordPress is WooCommerce, and how much of the internet is Woo? And every time I hear this number, it changes a little bit. But every time I hear it, it&#8217;s still breathtakingly large.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:24] <strong>James Kemp:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s an interesting one actually. In terms of how much of WordPress is Woo, I&#8217;m not sure on that. I think we could probably calculate that based on the figures I do have, which is how much of e-commerce is WooCommerce, and that is 37%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:41] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> 37%. Okay, so whatever the percentage is, be it the top million websites or the top 10,000 websites, whatever that metric is, let&#8217;s assume that that&#8217;s solid and safe. 37% is done on a WooCommerce platform. That is breathtaking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:56] <strong>James Kemp:</strong> Which is a huge amount, for the listeners, and for you if you want to check it out later. If you go to woocommerce.com/newsroom, we update these numbers every month. We have some numbers there, like there&#8217;s 3.6 million live installations. 37% of e-commerce sites are powered by WooCommerce. There&#8217;s 1,000 plus official marketplace extensions. That&#8217;s actually going to grow, I think substantially this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, yeah, some other stats that are listed there, which I think are useful to keep an eye on. And there&#8217;s, I believe the team that updates those numbers kind of, they take the data primarily from Store Leads, which is a data gathering outfit. And I think they kind of dial them back a bit, rather than, you know, inflating them, I think they actually go the other way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:41] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> In terms of the trend of that, so the 37%, I&#8217;m not looking at that chart at the moment, but is your impression that, has it stagnated, has it gone up broadly in the last, let&#8217;s say five years, something like that? Is WooCommerce basically growing, stagnating, declining?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:54] <strong>James Kemp:</strong> Over the five year, I would expect it&#8217;s gone up. There&#8217;s no graph to look at. There probably is somewhere, but I don&#8217;t have it in front of me now. But I do know that this was updated this week, I believe. And it was updated from 35% to 37. So there&#8217;s definite growth there. And I would expect, just the nature of e-commerce in general, that that number&#8217;s grown over the course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:16] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> When you say that, what&#8217;s the thing in your head which is promoting you to say the nature of e-commerce? Because I really don&#8217;t follow e-commerce, but I have this impression that during the lockdown period, 2019 and on, it felt like everybody, for very credible reasons, had to move whatever they were selling to an online format. So I imagine there was a bump there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also it feels like the world is now inundated with pocket size technology, which means that I can buy anything 24/7, no matter where I am. And so it feels like high streets in the UK, the shutters are going up. Bricks and mortar shops seem to be closing. Certainly where I live, that is a broad trend. It&#8217;s not particularly rapid, but it&#8217;s definitely a trend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m imagining that the confluence of mobile technology, ubiquity of internet connection, computers available all over the place, certainly in the country where you and I both live. It feels like this inexorable rise, this trend towards purchasing things at 4 o&#8217;clock in the afternoon, sitting on a sofa, a bus, wherever you might be. It does feel like that&#8217;s the way the world is moving. Are those kind of the intuitions that you have when you say WooCommerce is rising for obvious reasons?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:23] <strong>James Kemp:</strong> Yeah, exactly. I think just the nature of the internet and the online world has kind of exponentially grown since its inception, right? And I would expect that e-commerce will grow with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think one of the greatest things about the internet is that you can buy online. I should look into the history actually, but I can&#8217;t imagine what the thought process was back when the internet was invented. Did they imagine that e-commerce would be a thing? That people would buy stuff, even from the other side of the world, and have it shipped out to them in a matter of days or weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I just think as technology evolves, and we&#8217;ve seen the boom in AI, and just the boom in like generational development on computers, and coding and all of that is advancing, and I think e-commerce will follow suit as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, it feels like there&#8217;s no place but an upward trend for e-commerce. Now, whether or not WooCommerce fits into that landscape perfectly in the next decade, we&#8217;ll see. But it feels like I, and I can really only rely on myself, I feel like I&#8217;m going to buy more things online in the decade to come than I am this year. It feels like each and every year, my desire to get on my bike and go into the town centre dwindles, and I&#8217;m far more likely to buy things online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now the merchants have pivoted their offerings so that, you know, if you don&#8217;t like it, you can freely return it and things like that. So even the impediments that were there have suddenly changed, and it&#8217;s just remarkable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also the mere fact, just capture in your head for a moment, the fact that you can get all of this for no money down. The WooCommerce platform, and I know, in order to get the best out of it, you will definitely want marketplace things, third party, but other places as well. But the thing is free. It&#8217;s completely free. And I find that utterly remarkable. I just think that&#8217;s breathtaking in all honesty, that that&#8217;s available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:15] <strong>James Kemp:</strong> Yeah, I think it&#8217;s one of the key selling points about WooCommerce is that you can get started for free, as close to free as possible, when you account for hosting and transactional fees that naturally come with any platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But on top of that, with WooCommerce specifically, and with the age of AI now, you could make WooCommerce do what you want it to do for free. And every site could be tailored to specific needs, and like a specific execution of functionality without too much technical knowledge, which I think is really interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you&#8217;ve seen people are building apps, and I&#8217;ve built a few as well, specifically for needs that they want to solve. I saw one yesterday, I think it was Maddie on, Twitter, I can link to it. She built an app to automatically put an emoji over faces in photos. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve seen, when parents share photos of other people&#8217;s children and that kind of thing, they typically put an emoji over the face. She said she was getting annoyed at having to do that with every photo. But we&#8217;re in that era now where you can kind of roll these things with no technical knowledge, whether the output is good, I think is questionable, but it&#8217;s pretty good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:24] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Does the advent of AI, and what you&#8217;re suggesting, you can add your third party stuff, if you like, for want of a better word, to WooCommerce with the assistance of AI. Does that undermine the longevity of the free, open source WooCommerce project? Because I imagine that there&#8217;s a lot of underpinnings there, you know, the marketplace that WooCommerce, as I imagine those plugins that are sold to add different functionality and what have you, that must in some way pay for the freeness of it all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Does AI, does that concern you? You know, that if we erode the need to purchase third party software in order to get out what you desire, yeah, does that erode the possibility of WooCommerce being free in the future?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:05] <strong>James Kemp:</strong> I don&#8217;t think so. I think it assists. I think it depends what you&#8217;re making. Like, I wouldn&#8217;t want to build out a full subscriptions platform just using an AI prompt. And maybe that will become more advanced in the future. I think as someone running a business, you don&#8217;t want to be dealing with this code yourself, maintaining it, making sure it stays up to date. And I think that&#8217;s the case for, or that has been the case since e-commerce software existed. There used to be a trend of rolling your own e-commerce solutions, and I think that&#8217;s less likely to happen these days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:39] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s a good point. If you think about just a regular WordPress website, if it&#8217;s just a brochure site with no e-commerce attached, go with the AI, you know, it seems like there&#8217;s loads of scope there. But obviously if you&#8217;ve got the compliance, and the financial obligation, and all of the law that underpins an e-commerce shop, I imagine there are impediments in people&#8217;s heads which will say, wait, did an AI make that? Are we really going to trust that? So maybe it inoculates itself given the nature of the websites which are in question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, just moving on, tell us a little bit about the kind of people that are using WooCommerce. Now, I know this is a very, very broad question, but in my head, for some reason I have it, that a significant amount of people that are using WooCommerce will be small stores. But I&#8217;m guessing also maybe WooCommerce really does dig deep into the enterprise as well. Does it run the gamut of everything? Or is there a kind of focus for you, and teams within Automattic because there&#8217;s a certain type of clientele which largely consume WooCommerce?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:37] <strong>James Kemp:</strong> Yeah, it does kind of span everything. So people just starting out either want low cost, in which case WooCommerce is an obvious choice. You can start setting things up, especially for brand new e-commerce, whereas they&#8217;re just selling single products. There&#8217;s nothing too technical there that would require an expense of some kind. So it&#8217;s super easy to spin up a WooCommerce site and test it out pretty much free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yeah, we have that audience. It&#8217;s not necessarily our focus, our focus is primarily the higher revenue, higher traffic e-commerce stores, because that&#8217;s the aspiration for anyone selling, right? They want to become successful, they want that to be their business, is e-commerce. And those are the users that we&#8217;re focused on. And then naturally anything we do for them is going to trickle down to benefit the people who are just starting out with the platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it does span a wide range of users, but we do focus in on the higher revenue and high product volume, high traffic, those kind of things. Or at least that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re focusing on this year. That target evolves over time. But that&#8217;s been our focus for most of my time since I&#8217;ve been here. So it&#8217;s nice to have that vision of who&#8217;s using it and what we can do to make the platform as good as possible for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:52] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> We have this expression in the UK, Jack of all trades, master of none. I don&#8217;t know how that works outside of the boundaries of the UK, but it basically means if you try to be everything to everybody, you sort of succeed at nothing. It&#8217;s something akin to that basically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m wondering if there are bits of WooCommerce which you have to manage those sort of trade offs. Like, okay, if we build this thing, which feels like it&#8217;s a real enterprisey thing, how is that going to work with our more modest users, let&#8217;s say?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or if we really focus on the more modest users, how are the enterprise going to feel like that? And it not being a niche, and it being the full spectrum of sites out there, yeah, at times that must be actually quite frustrating, I would&#8217;ve thought.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:29] <strong>James Kemp:</strong> It&#8217;s a challenge, yeah. It&#8217;s something that we&#8217;re working on at the moment, is making the base of WooCommerce have the majority of features for the majority of users, the features that you&#8217;d expect in an e-commerce platform, which I&#8217;ve touched on in other podcasts if you want to go and find them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s a process called More in Core, which is the kind of code name for it. Where we&#8217;re just trying to build out the base product to have the majority of things that merchants and builders need, without needing to go and find all these plugins and custom development and things like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the challenge is which features. The features that people need are going to change depending on what type of store they&#8217;re running. So I&#8217;ve seen a lot of people want subscriptions in Core. And then I&#8217;ve also seen the complete opposite where people don&#8217;t want subscriptions in Core because they see it as bloat. There&#8217;s a challenge there for sure, to figure out what that kind of sweet spot is without being bloated, but also without nickel and dimming, and making the average number of plugins required too high or too low.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:28] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I&#8217;ve often thought that if I worked at Microsoft on Windows, the software, the OS, it would be my constant annoyance that I had to think about every possible permutation of hardware that could ever be used. Whereas if I worked for Apple and was working on the Mac OS project, it&#8217;d be like, there&#8217;s just this one set of hardware, it&#8217;s just so much more straightforward, we build it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I imagine that commercial rivals, things like Shopify, and we can get into that in a moment, probably have it easier in that sense because there isn&#8217;t this, well, I know that they have an ecosystem of sort of third party apps, I believe they&#8217;re called. But there isn&#8217;t this whole backwards compatibility thing that 5,000 different plugins that bind into WooCommerce and what have you. And so I guess you&#8217;ve always got to be taking real careful steps when you develop a new feature or tweak anything, which maybe the other platforms don&#8217;t have to think about in quite the same way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:16] <strong>James Kemp:</strong> Yeah, I actually posted about that exact thing on X or Twitter earlier. I&#8217;m just going to call it X. I want to call it Twitter, but I&#8217;m going to call it X. It&#8217;s a challenge because, and this touches on the 37% number, like any update we roll out is affecting over a third of all e-commerce stores online, which is a crazy number.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has to be backwards compatible, it has to be rolled out in a way that isn&#8217;t going to break things. There&#8217;s a lot more consideration that needs to happen because of the multitude of environments that could exist. There could be bad hosting, there could be good hosting. There could be low performance, high performance, number of products, different plugins, different themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a platform like ours, that is one of the greatest challenges, but also one of the greatest strengths as well, because of how flexible it is. In a platform like Shopify, like you say, they have an app marketplace, but it&#8217;s a lot more restricted. There&#8217;s only really a handful of ways to do something. Whereas with WooCommerce, you&#8217;ve kind of got full control because you are hosting it yourself. You can pretty much do anything. Which, like I say, is a challenge, but also a strength.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It requires navigation, and I touched on this in a, I do a monthly, Inside wooCommerce podcast. The last one that went out was with Julia, who is the lead for our release process. And it&#8217;s worth a listen, because it&#8217;s quite interesting to hear, now, how we roll out releases and how we&#8217;re able to test and watch for signals for issues that might arise. And be able to roll it back, fix that, and then roll out the updates. There&#8217;s quite a nice process there now, which we&#8217;ll obviously refine as time goes on, but yeah, it&#8217;s a challenge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:59] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> More recently, and we don&#8217;t need to get into the story behind it, but there is a story behind it. But the Automatticians, so the people that work for Automattic, have in some cases been repurposed. So their work that they&#8217;ve been doing for many years in one direction has now been pivoted. And I think it&#8217;s probably fair to say that focusing on things which generate revenue is a crucial part of the decision behind that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m wondering if that&#8217;s had an impact. So this whole thing is not really that old, it&#8217;s maybe only five, six weeks old, something like that, so maybe it hasn&#8217;t yet. But I&#8217;m wondering if it&#8217;s had actually a positive impact on the teams that you work with, or maybe there&#8217;s steady away, no change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:38] <strong>James Kemp:</strong> I would say there&#8217;s no change actually. I mean, WooCommerce has always been, we&#8217;re building a free product, but we are also a business, and we&#8217;ve always been a business. We wouldn&#8217;t be able to afford to put out a product and not have any money coming in to continue developing it. There&#8217;s always been a business aspect to WooCommerce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But yeah, the teams that have kind of moved off of the open source contributions that they were making previously, I haven&#8217;t seen any of them come over to WooCommerce. And maybe they have, if they come in as engineers, then I probably wouldn&#8217;t see that anyway. But yeah, in my day to day, I haven&#8217;t seen an impact. But, you know, Automattic has multiple products and experiments and things that exist outside of WooCommerce, and I honestly don&#8217;t dig into them too much. I&#8217;m very focused on the WooCommerce side of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:27] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You&#8217;ve recently, I say you, WooCommerce recently had an entire upending of the branding. If you don&#8217;t follow it very closely, it may be that you haven&#8217;t seen this story, but maybe it was not that long ago in the last week or so. It feels like the message dropped that a lot of the branding has been redone, and I often look at rebranding and I think why all that effort?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What was really the point of that? What was the need to upend everything, and make people have to see something new? And I&#8217;m just wondering if you know what the point of that was? I mean, it&#8217;s nice. It looks lovely. Don&#8217;t get me wrong. I thoroughly love it. But I&#8217;m curious as to what the reasoning was. Did it feel stale previously? What was going on there? Do you know?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:06] <strong>James Kemp:</strong> All of the above, yeah. So I&#8217;ve known about the branding, in its current form of, what it&#8217;s gonna be like since maybe October last year. And it&#8217;s been really interesting to watch. If you compare what we had previously against this, it&#8217;s clear like why it had to happen. The branding that we had previously was the same branding that WooCommerce had when it was initially formed via WooThemes. If you compare it, it just looks out of date. The colors are flat and, not very inspiring. And the new branding now allows us to be a bit more modern, I think. It&#8217;s modernized the brand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it also opens us up to be able to go out and do more effective marketing and acquisition that we haven&#8217;t done prior. Branding isn&#8217;t just changing the logo and updating some colors. There&#8217;s a whole array of assets that come with it, and like a story behind the assets and what we&#8217;re trying to put out there into the world. Which we didn&#8217;t have before, we just had a logo and some colors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:04] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> There&#8217;s this sort of nod to a shopping cart in the W of Woo, which is actually quite clever, I think. And you&#8217;re right, it does just smack of more modern.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being a complete non-designer, I can never summon up the vocabulary to express why I think something looks good. But saw the new branding, and I saw the video that was associated with that, and I did think, yeah, that&#8217;s great. That looks really great, but I can&#8217;t for the life of me tell you why it looks great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But interestingly though, was there a market push, not just because it was stale, and let&#8217;s move this conversation into the rise of the SaaS. Because over the last period, the Wixs, the Squarespaces, the Shopify and all of these other things, I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s many more. They&#8217;ve brought to the market a fairly affordable alternative. There&#8217;s nothing free, as far as I&#8217;m aware, but it&#8217;s a fairly low monthly cost. And I imagine over time these companies are eating up some of the new people, maybe even taking people from WooCommerce. I imagine it&#8217;s a bit of ebb and flow and what have you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But was it that, were they becoming more professional, more visible in the world? Super Bowl ads and all that kind of thing. Was there some of that in the rebranding as well?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:14] <strong>James Kemp:</strong> Yeah, I imagine so. I think if you look at our branding previously, I don&#8217;t think it was necessarily thought out as a brand as such. I think it evolved over time. Whereas this was, the rebrand was much more focused, who are we trying to connect with here? What type of customer are we trying to pull in? And how can we reach them? What do they want to see? And I don&#8217;t think we had that before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And yeah, definitely it helps us compete with these SaaS solutions that are quite easy to pitch. You know, influencer can pitch this stuff, because they have cool branding and, it&#8217;s hard to say really.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like I think you could say about any product, like if Apple had a really badly designed, like 3D Apple from the nineties as their logo. In this modern era of what you expect from a brand, and a brand that&#8217;s powering 37% of all e-commerce or, I don&#8217;t what Apple&#8217;s market share on mobile devices is, but I imagine it&#8217;s pretty high.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s just something that needs to be considered, and there needs to be a thought process behind why we look like we do, and who we want to attract with that. And we didn&#8217;t have that before with the previous speech bubble thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:25] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I remember listening to, I believe it was Bill Gates, this is many years ago, and Bill Gates was asked a question by an interviewer and it was, what keeps you awake at night, in terms of the longevity of Microsoft? And he said three things. Google, Google and Google. And basically he&#8217;s terrified of Google.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m gonna pitch the same sort of question to you. Of the SaaS things out there, are there any bits out there which make the Woo team think, oh gosh, that&#8217;s interesting. We need to copy that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Does the sort of gouging out of the pricing, their very affordable pricing, those kind of things. How do you cope with that? How do you compete with that, with something which is basically free? I don&#8217;t know if that keeps you awake at night.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:06] <strong>James Kemp:</strong> Obviously like any business has its competitors. There&#8217;s nothing that&#8217;s come up that we&#8217;ve been like, oh, we&#8217;ve got to copy that and we&#8217;ve got to get that in. It&#8217;s more like comparatively are we offering an equal playing field to a potential customer?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this ties back into the More in Core stuff that I was talking about. Is there stuff that not just Shopify, but other platforms have in their core offering, and this may be like low priced or free plans, or there&#8217;s other self-hosted versions as well that exist. They are comparatively free. Are we offering the same functionality? Do we have those essential features available? Yeah, we do, but do we charge for them? Probably, if there&#8217;s stuff that&#8217;s missing, there&#8217;s probably a premium extension for it. Or there&#8217;s a free extension for it, but it requires the merchant to go out and find it, rather than like us presenting it to them as a solution when they need it contextually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, things like that are definitely considerations. We need to be innovating, and we need to be keeping up as well. That could be said about any platform versus another platform that there&#8217;s always, again, going back to Apple, Apple and Samsung have this kind of to and fro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yeah, it&#8217;s a consideration for sure. The target audience of someone going onto Shopify versus someone going onto WooCommerce is slightly different. The kind of core things that they are looking for are what we need to be offering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:31] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, that&#8217;s interesting because if I was a WooCommerce user, which as I explained I&#8217;m not, that would be the sentence I needed to hear, I think. The people working in the offices and the places where you are working is, okay, we are keeping an eye on what the competition are doing. And if something is a moving, shaking feature, which is upsetting the industry and everybody wants it, then you&#8217;ve at least got your beedy on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:55] <strong>James Kemp:</strong> That&#8217;s one part of it as well. What are the competitors doing, but also what are our marketplace sales saying? What are the trends saying in e-commerce, even TikTok, Amazon, like all those kind of things that aren&#8217;t directly related to what we do, that&#8217;s accounted for as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also what are the customers saying? And we touched on it earlier, but we have a whole, what we call the feedback river, which is just a big database of feedback from everywhere. From within the plugin itself. From support. From reviews and from wordpress.org, and like all of these places combined into one database. So yeah, I think you have to keep an eye on all of it. And the challenge is figuring out is this essential? What percentage of users actually want this specific thing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And actually that&#8217;s always been a challenge, like even working on much smaller scale products at Iconic, it was always hard if a customer reaches out and says, oh, I wish it did this, it was hard to say no to that, because you are excited that someone&#8217;s using it, and they want to adapt it to their own use case. But you have to take into account, is the effort to implement this going to be valuable for everyone? Is this the priority for the majority, or is it just going satisfy this one person? You have to do that at scale now, or I have to do that at scale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:14] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I know that time is short, so I&#8217;m just going to pivot just for one final question before we leave and it&#8217;s, it really has nothing to do with WooCommerce specifically, although it may? And that is, I&#8217;m just curious if you know of any interesting things which are happening around the periphery of e-commerce that you personally are finding interesting and engaging. Something that maybe our general audience won&#8217;t have come across, because they&#8217;re not deep in the weeds of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That could be inside WordPress. I dunno, the Interactivity API, or it could be something the browsers are thinking about doing, or third party vendors who&#8217;ve got some curious technology that we might not have heard of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, really just any interesting thing that James has spotted lately that you think we might want to look at?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:54] <strong>James Kemp:</strong> Yeah, I dunno whether I have anything that nobody&#8217;s ever heard of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:57] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:58] <strong>James Kemp:</strong> There&#8217;s a definite rise in platforms offering their own e-commerce. So, TikTok, commerce and all that kind of stuff is growing. And you touched on, something before we started the call actually, which kind of relates to that, the ability to see something on a device and just purchase it there and then. And within TikTok you get that experience. Within a typical e-commerce platform, you have a flow that you go through. You&#8217;ve got the cart, and then the checkout. You&#8217;ve got to populate details. So yeah, I think there&#8217;s gonna be a, an evolution into how quickly can I buy something. And that&#8217;s what the merchants want. Whether it&#8217;s good for the population and spending habits, I&#8217;m not entirely sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I personally love the experience on, like Amazon, for example, and I don&#8217;t know how long they&#8217;ve had it, it&#8217;s been there a while now. But on product pages, you don&#8217;t need to go through the cart process, you can just click buy now. Although that has tripped me up a couple of times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:53] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, me too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:54] <strong>James Kemp:</strong> You press buy now, and it goes on some card that you never use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yeah, I think that is a definite kind of trend, that I&#8217;ve seen a lot of. And I think we touched on something earlier as well, which I haven&#8217;t seen much in the way of solutions to it. But one of the key things about people buying from a brick and mortar is that they can try on the product and they can physically see the color of a product, and touch the product. Which is possible. You can order now and it&#8217;s getting a lot easier to return stuff. But can you do that with a sofa, for example? So, I expect that we&#8217;ll see some innovations around that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:33] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Sort of augmented solution, where you can drop room and, yeah, size it up, and things like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:38] <strong>James Kemp:</strong> Yeah. I don&#8217;t know what that looks like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:40] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> No, and it will be sort of a strange simulation of reality, but probably enough to get a proportion of the people over the wire, I would&#8217;ve thought.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:48] <strong>James Kemp:</strong> Yeah, for sure. There&#8217;s been AR stuff for a while now, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:51] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, and things like, you want to put a logo on a t-shirt, here&#8217;s what that look like on the t-shirt. Those kind of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think for me, one of the most, most interesting things is what the mobile wallets have done to my capacity to spend. I just that is remarkable. Especially out in the real world where you take the Tube in London, the underground, and you just don&#8217;t do anything anymore. You just walk by a thing, and your phone&#8217;s in your pocket, and it registers it, and you walk out and at the end of the day you get a bill, and so these kind of seamless solutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:21] <strong>James Kemp:</strong> I don&#8217;t feel like you have that so much on a computer though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:24] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> No, but I wonder if that&#8217;s coming with, I don&#8217;t know, biometrics. Like purchase this, put your finger print in, your done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:33] <strong>James Kemp:</strong> I think that would be nice. I still populate, I use 1Password, so it does it for me, but I still populate the card.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:39] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> An intermediary, a trusted intermediary getting in the way. Yeah, it&#8217;s interesting. Again, I wonder if those kind of things might be handled natively by browsers, and things like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, we&#8217;re sort of staring into the future, and we&#8217;ve no idea. But I know that you&#8217;ve got to go in about 30 seconds time, so I will just round it off by saying James Kemp, fascinating chat about all things WooCommerce. I appreciate it, and all the hard work you and your team are doing to democratize e-commerce. Is there anything you want to add just before we round it off? Maybe a Twitter handle or something like that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:08] <strong>James Kemp:</strong> I&#8217;m jamesckemp on most things. C, the letter C. Yeah. The only thing I&#8217;ll add is just, if you have questions, ideas, theories, my dms are open there, so I&#8217;m happy to hear it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:21] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Well, thank you very much, James Kemp. Been a pleasure chatting to you today. Really appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:25] <strong>James Kemp:</strong> Thank you very much.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://x.com/jamesckemp\">James Kemp</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James is the Core Product Lead for WooCommerce.

It fed us.\" />\nHere is Aleksandr reading his own story aloud.\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Dedicated to the third sorrowful anniversary of the war. With gratitude to our European partners.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-company-built-in-the-heart-of-kharkiv\">A Company Built in the Heart of Kharkiv</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before the war, our company was thriving in the center of Kharkiv — a large, developed, and beautiful million-strong city. We lived and worked just 45 kilometers away from what turned out to be a massive ticking time bomb.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We had just completed a beautiful new office renovation — a space filled with energy, collaboration, and ambition. At the time, DreamDev had two divisions: one handling large-scale projects with Laravel and Vue.js, and the other — a WordPress agency primarily working with Elementor and WPBakery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We believed our future lay in big, ambitious U.S. projects. We chased tight deadlines, endured weekend calls, and thrived under pressure. It was exhausting and stressful, but we had no idea that the real challenge was yet to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-february-24-2022-the-day-our-world-collapsed\">February 24, 2022 – The Day Our World Collapsed</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>No one believed war was possible. Even as rumors spread, we convinced ourselves: </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>&#8220;This can’t happen. Not here. Not in the 21st century&#8221;&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, at 4 AM on February 24, our world turned upside down. Our work chats flooded with messages: &#8220;The war has started.&#8221; Explosions shook the city. The sky turned red with fire. Deafening sounds filled the air. We later learned they were Grad rockets, but at that moment, all we felt was shock, fear, and disbelief.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our brand-new office stood empty. The streets outside looked like a scene from a dystopian movie — people running, children crying, cars were abandoned. As we hurried to gather what we could, Russian tanks were already at the city’s outskirts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And just like that, a new chapter of DreamDev’s story had begun.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-survival-mode-when-there-s-no-plan-just-action\">Survival Mode: When There’s No Plan, Just Action</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We left Kharkiv, seeking shelter in an old house on the city’s outskirts — a place built before World War I. A war from another time, yet history was repeating itself. Our memories from those first days are scattered, and fragmented — banks stopped working, teammates went silent, chaos spread. We had no answers. But we had work. So, five days into the war, we sent out a message to our partners: <em>&#8220;Please don’t worry. We are still working.&#8221;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-losing-everything-and-gaining-something-even-greater\">Losing Everything – and Gaining Something Even Greater</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Then came the real test. Most of our U.S. partners left. A major Norwegian project was scared to death of the news and canceled the team of 3 developers and a PM working for them. We lost our biggest contracts. But something we never expected happened:<br />Every single one of our European partners stayed. Not only that — they gave us even more projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They believed in us. They supported us. And because of them, we survived. Laravel projects disappeared. We lost key developers. But WordPress kept us afloat. It fed us. It fed our families in the hardest moments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we focused on what we did best: custom, complex WordPress development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team kept evolving. We became our own sales department, reaching out from a century-old house while watching missiles hit the heart of Kharkiv and fighter jets fall from the sky.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>&#8220;I will never forget the sound of a plane flying over my head. The mushroom cloud rising above the Officers&#8217; House. The windows in my home were blown out by the blast wave.&#8221;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>At that time, only four of us remained in Kharkiv — two founders, our HR manager, and a project manager. Everyone else had left.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-back-to-the-office-and-into-the-fire\">Back to the Office – And Into the Fire</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After six months of working from home, we made the decision: Return to the office. Every commute felt like it could be the last. But we had no choice — we had to keep moving forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the end of 2022, we fully committed to what we did best: custom WordPress development and complex UX/UI design</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was hard. It was frustrating. But it was stimulating. At this point, it felt like a survival game.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-blackouts-bombs-and-business-as-usual\">Blackouts, Bombs, and Business as Usual</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As Russian missiles targeted Ukraine’s power grid, the country was plunged into darkness. The only sound? Generators humming in the streets. We spent hours hunting for an internet connection, sitting in gas stations, just to tell our partners: </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>&#8220;We are alive. Your project will be delivered on time.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>With no electricity, no news, and no phone signal, we kept working. Our European partners kept us afloat.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-team-that-never-stopped\">The Team That Never Stopped</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>By 2023, almost our entire pre-war team was gone. New faces joined, but the spirit remained the same: Adapt. Survive. Deliver.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>We worked without electricity, without water, without heating. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Some in Kharkiv, some in Poltava, some in Dnipro. But we never stopped building. Reflecting on the past, it&#8217;s hard to believe that we were able to endure and remain steadfast.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-2024-wordpress-is-changing-so-are-we\">2024: WordPress Is Changing. So Are We.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This year, WordPress is evolving — the rise of low-code and no-code solutions is shifting the landscape. The war’s impact on the European economy&#8217;s growth and projects is slowing down. But our partners — the ones who stood by us — were still here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-2025-the-war-continues-but-so-do-we\">2025: The War Continues, But So Do We</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The war isn’t over. And yet, the partners and teammates who believed in us never left. This is more than just WordPress development. This is resilience. This is survival. This is the future we are building together.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"kb-row-layout-wrap kb-row-layout-id7787_60f515-6b alignfull kt-row-has-bg wp-block-kadence-rowlayout\"><div class=\"kt-row-column-wrap kt-has-1-columns kt-row-layout-equal kt-tab-layout-inherit kt-mobile-layout-row kt-row-valign-top\">\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-kadence-column kadence-column7787_2a9fc3-fa\"><div class=\"kt-inside-inner-col\">\n<p class=\"kt-adv-heading7787_deaaf3-3e wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\">Editor&#8217;s Note: The normal fee for the banner for this essay will instead be donated to a charity that supports Ukraine.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n</div></div><p>The post <a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/from-warfare-to-wordpress-how-we-survived-and-transformed/\">From Warfare to WordPress: How We Survived and Transformed</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 05 Mar 2025 06:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Aleks Bochlin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:34;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"WordPress.org blog: WordPress 6.8 Beta 1\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=18582\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2025/03/wordpress-6-8-beta-1/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10494:\"<p>WordPress 6.8 Beta 1 is ready for download and testing!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This beta version of the WordPress software is under development.</strong> Please do not install, run, or test this version of WordPress on production or mission-critical websites.

WordPress 6.8 brings a luster and gloss that only a polish release can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.8 Beta 1 contains over 370 enhancements and 520 bug fixes for the editor, including design improvements, polishing the query loop, and more than <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&milestone=6.8&group=component&max=500&col=id&col=summary&col=owner&col=type&col=priority&col=component&col=version&order=priority\">230 tickets for WordPress 6.8 Core</a>. Here’s a glimpse of what’s coming:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Editor improvements</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Easier ways to see your options in Data Views, and you can opt to ignore sticky posts in the Query Loop. Plus you’ll find lots of little improvements in the editor!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Style Book comes to Classic themes</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Style Book now features a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/68036\">structured layout</a> so you can preview site colors, typography, and block styles more easily. You can use the Style Book in classic themes with editor-styles or a theme.json file and includes clearer labels, and you can find them under <code>Appearance &gt; Design</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Support for Speculation browser API</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.8 introduces native support for speculative loading, leveraging the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Speculation_Rules_API\">Speculation Rules API</a> to improve site performance with near-instant page loads. This feature prefetches or prerenders URLs based on user interactions, such as hovering over links, reducing load times for subsequent pages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By default, WordPress 6.8 applies a conservative prefetching strategy, balancing performance gains with resource efficiency. Developers can customize speculative loading behavior using new filters, since the API does not include UI-based controls. The existing <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/speculation-rules/\">Speculative Loading feature plugin</a> will adapt to the core implementation, allowing deeper customization.&nbsp; Please test this feature in supported browsers (currently Chrome 108+ and Edge 108+, with more browsers evaluating) and provide feedback on <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/62503\">#62503</a> to help refine its implementation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Major security boost</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.8 will use bcrypt for password hashing, which <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2025/02/17/wordpress-6-8-will-use-bcrypt-for-password-hashing/\">significantly hardens WordPress.</a> Other hashing is getting hardened, too, throughout the security apparatus. You won’t have to change anything in your daily workflow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The features included in this first beta may change before the final release of WordPress 6.8, based on what testers like you find.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get an overview of the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/6-8/\">6.8 release cycle</a> and check the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">Make WordPress Core blog</a> for<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/6-8/\"> 6.8-related posts</a> in the next few weeks for further details.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Caveat on testing 6.8 Beta 1 in versions older than 5.1</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to an update made to the upgrade routine during this release, (see <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/59803\">r59803</a>), any upgrade from versions older than 5.1 will fail. Folks are working to resolve this specific issue, so please hold off on reporting on this while testing the Beta 1 release.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Vulnerability bounty doubles during Beta &amp; Release Candidate</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress community sponsors a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/#enhanced-bounty-rewards-during-beta-and-release-candidate-phases\">monetary reward for reporting new, unreleased security vulnerabilities</a>. This reward doubles during the period between Beta 1 on March 4, 2025 and the final Release Candidate (RC) scheduled for April 15, 2025.  Please follow responsible disclosure practices as detailed in the project’s security practices and policies. You can find those on the <a href=\"https://hackerone.com/wordpress\">HackerOne page</a> and in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/security/\">security white paper</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Just for you: a Beta 1 haiku</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>March winds shift the tide.<br />Hands unite in open source;<br />WordPress moves ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p

So, naturally, companies that tailor their onboarding see higher retention rates, increased feature adoption, and stronger customer relationships. Their users are more likely to become product champions and recommend the service to others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the numbers back this up.

The challenge? Balancing the need to collect essential user data while keeping friction low.

Many companies ask for the company website and department, as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the beginning of the process, you can use <a href=\"https://gravatar.com/\">Gravatar</a> to help you out.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"2160\" height=\"1140\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/gravatar-paas-wordpress.png\" alt=\"Gravatar – Profile as a Service \" class=\"wp-image-2550\" />\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if you’re using WordPress to build your website, some level of Gravatar functionality will already be enabled. <a href=\"http://wordpress.org\">WordPress.org</a> will automatically pull in user avatars, or <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/07/19/wordpress-profile-picture/\">profile pictures</a>, connected to their Gravatar profiles.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1744\" height=\"946\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/wordpress-org-gravatar-profile-picture.png\" alt=\"Profile picture in WordPress.org\" class=\"wp-image-2552\" />\n\n\n\n<p>However, you can extend this in a massive way, through the free <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/gravatar-enhanced/\">Gravatar Enhanced plugin</a> to add features like the profile block, which is perfect for author pages and websites focused on creating a community. This block lets you automatically display user information pulled in from their profiles, such as their bio and verified links.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"377\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/gravatar-profile-block.png?w=660\" alt=\"Gravatar profile block\" class=\"wp-image-2575\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Another option to integrate Gravatar on a deeper level is with the <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/06/03/profiles-as-a-service/\">REST API</a> – and you can do this whether you’re on a WordPress website or not. This allows you to auto-populate user profiles instantly when someone signs up with their email address. This reduces manual data entry while still gathering rich profile information for personalization, which is especially effective with <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/10/08/saas-onboarding-checklist/\">SaaS onboarding</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://docs.gravatar.com/getting-started/\"><img width=\"3242\" height=\"729\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/gravatar_integration_cta.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2632\" /></a>\n\n\n\n<p>What makes this a gamechanger is that all websites that integrate with Gravatar pull in information from a unified source, which allows you to create familiar experience for users across multiple platforms while reducing sign-up friction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to take it further? Use progressive profiling:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Collect essential information during sign-up.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ask for additional details as users engage with specific features.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use behavior patterns to build user profiles over time.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Allow users to import data from existing profiles.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember to test different form variations with real users. Track completion rates and drop-off points to optimize the process continuously.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Step 2: Automated welcome email</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The welcome email acts as your first direct communication with new users. It needs to accomplish several goals while remaining clear and engaging.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, to make your welcome email effective, you need to first use an effective subject line. Here are some examples:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>&#8220;Welcome to [Product] – Here&#8217;s your next step&#8221;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>&#8220;You&#8217;re in! Let&#8217;s get started with [Product]&#8221;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>&#8220;[Name], welcome aboard! Your account is ready&#8221;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re not sure what to include, you can structure the email content like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Start with a personal greeting using their name.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Confirm their account creation.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Highlight one clear next action.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Include essential links without overwhelming them.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, this is the welcome email we send to our users when they create a Gravatar profile:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><tbody><tr><td>Hello!<strong>Your email now has a profile!</strong>There are two things you should know about Gravatar:<strong>Your email can introduce yourself</strong><br /><img width=\"976\" height=\"480\" class=\"wp-image-2553\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/gravatar-profiles-across-different-websites.gif\" alt=\"\" /><br />Anytime you share your email, it’s like handing over a digital business card.

Its purpose? Moving users from sign-up to actual engagement with your product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A strong follow-up email includes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Recognition of whether they&#8217;ve logged in yet.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>One specific action they can take right now.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Clear value proposition for that action.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Estimated time commitment.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a tested template:</p>\n\n\n\n<table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Subject:</strong> Ready for your first [specific win] with [Product]?<br /><br />Hi [Name],<br /><br /><strong>Quick check-in:</strong> Have you had a chance to [specific action] yet?&nbsp;<br />It takes just 5 minutes to [achieve specific outcome].

For instance, customize examples and use cases that match their industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Step 4: Choosing the right onboarding strategy for your product</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Selecting the right onboarding approach determines how effectively users will adopt your product. Let&#8217;s examine four proven strategies and when to use each one.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>One-on-one onboarding</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Enterprise software with complex implementations demands personal attention. This high-touch approach works best for products with annual contract values above $10,000 or solutions requiring custom workflows. The direct interaction helps catch potential issues early and ensures users extract maximum value.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tips for successful one-on-one onboarding:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Record sessions for future reference.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Create custom agendas based on user roles.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Set clear milestones for each call.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Follow up with written summaries.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Track time to first value achievement.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Monitor customer satisfaction scores.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Group onboarding</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Mid-market solutions and team-based tools often benefit from group sessions. This approach builds community while efficiently onboarding multiple users who share similar needs. It&#8217;s particularly effective for products where users can learn from each other&#8217;s questions and use cases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keys to effective group onboarding:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Segment sessions by industry or use case.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Keep groups small (5-8 participants).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Include hands-on exercises.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Encourage peer learning.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Schedule sessions across convenient time zones.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Self-service onboarding</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Products with straightforward features or tech-savvy user bases thrive with self-service onboarding. This approach scales efficiently for high-volume, lower-price products where personal attention isn&#8217;t cost-effective.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Essential self-service elements include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Interactive product tours.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Short video tutorials.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Progress tracking.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Clear success milestones.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Help documentation.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Chat support option.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Hybrid approach</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Many successful products combine multiple approaches. Use self-service for basic features, group sessions for advanced functionality, and one-on-one support for custom needs. This flexibility lets you match support levels to user needs and value.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Implementation strategies:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Use data to trigger different support levels.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Monitor user progress automatically.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Offer easy ways to upgrade support.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Track which methods work best for different segments.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Adjust based on user feedback and engagement metrics.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Step 5: Setting initial goals and milestones</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Setting clear goals with users creates momentum and drives engagement. The trick lies in balancing ambition with achievability – goals should stretch users while remaining within reach. Success starts by understanding what matters most to each user through direct conversations about the problems they&#8217;re trying to solve and their vision for the first 30 days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Break larger objectives into manageable milestones. The first milestone should be achievable within 24-48 hours of signup, building confidence and showing immediate progress. Follow this with weekly targets for the first month, then transition to monthly milestones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simple gamification elements can boost motivation:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Progress bars showing completion status.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Achievement badges for hitting milestones.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Team leaderboards for group implementations.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravatar integration enhances this experience by displaying user avatars alongside achievements and in team views. This personalization makes the journey feel more engaging and tailored to each user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png\" alt=\"✨\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />Tip:</strong> <em>Set up automated monitoring to flag when users struggle with specific milestones. This allows customer success teams to step in proactively with support. Stay flexible and adjust goals based on user feedback and behavior patterns.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Step 6: Strategies for personalized onboarding</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Personalization transforms generic onboarding into targeted experiences that resonate with users. Advanced strategies go beyond basic segmentation, using real-time data and behavior patterns to adapt the experience for each user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, you can use AI-driven paths to analyze user actions and modify the onboarding flow automatically. So, when a user struggles with a specific feature, the system can offer extra guidance or suggest alternative approaches. This dynamic adaptation ensures users get help exactly when they need it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Integrating Gravatar adds another layer of personalization from the first interaction. The API provides valuable context about user roles and industries, allowing you to <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/08/16/user-experience-personalization/\">customize the UI</a>,&nbsp; examples, and terminology accordingly. A developer might see technical implementation details, while a marketing professional receives analytics-focused guidance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Micro-segmentation takes this further by combining behavioral data with profile insights. For example:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Tailor feature introductions based on past product usage.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Adjust communication frequency by engagement levels.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Customize success metrics for different roles.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember that <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/09/03/app-onboarding/\">in-app guidance</a> should feel natural and contextual. Rather than overwhelming users with information, show relevant tips when they&#8217;re most likely to need them. This might mean highlighting advanced features only after users master basics or suggesting integrations when usage patterns indicate they&#8217;d be valuable.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Step 7: Provide access to a detailed knowledge base</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>An effective knowledge base empowers users to find answers on their own terms. Rather than forcing users to contact support for every question, good documentation lets them solve problems at their own pace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s what we recommend:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Build your knowledge base around user needs, not product features.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Start with common questions and problems users face during onboarding.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Structure content in a logical flow that matches the user&#8217;s learning curve – from basic setup to advanced features.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Video tutorials and interactive guides complement written documentation. Short screencast tutorials work well for showing complex processes, while step-by-step guides help users implement specific features. Keep videos brief and focused on single tasks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>AI-powered search helps users find relevant information quickly. Smart categorization and related article suggestions guide users to helpful resources they might have missed. Think of your knowledge base as a living document and update it based on common support tickets, user feedback, product updates, and usage analytics.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, track which articles users read most and where they spend time. This data reveals gaps in documentation and helps prioritize future content creation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Step 8: Strategies for checking in with customers</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Regular check-ins help spot potential issues before they become problems. The best check-ins feel natural, not forced, and happen at moments that matter to users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best strategy is combining automated and personal outreach based on user behavior. After major milestones, send congratulatory messages with tips for the next steps. If usage drops suddenly, trigger a friendly check-in to offer help. Schedule more detailed reviews after the first week and first month to ensure users stay on track.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Personal check-ins should focus on learning, not just status updates. Ask specific questions about their experience and goals. For example: &#8220;Has [feature] helped with [specific goal] yet?&#8221; or &#8220;What&#8217;s been the biggest challenge so far?&#8221; These conversations often reveal valuable insights about user needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You also should have either a live chat option, email support, and/or video calls because they each serve different purposes. Quick questions work well in chat, while video calls help build relationships and tackle complex issues. Use email to share resources and document action items.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Step 9: Iterate based on feedback</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Feedback drives improvement, but only if you act on it systematically. Collect both quantitative data (usage statistics, completion rates) and qualitative insights (user interviews, survey responses) to build a complete picture.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Create feedback loops at every stage of onboarding.</strong> Short in-app surveys capture immediate reactions, while detailed questionnaires after key milestones provide deeper insights. User interviews reveal nuances that numbers alone might miss.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Take action quickly on clear pain points.</strong> If multiple users struggle with the same step, examine it closely. Sometimes, small tweaks, like clearer instructions or simplified workflows, make a big difference. Share improvements with users who provided feedback – it shows you value their input.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Build a systematic approach to evaluating and implementing changes:</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Analyze feedback patterns</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Prioritize high-impact changes</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Test solutions with small user groups</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Monitor results before rolling out widely</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Enhance your onboarding with Gravatar&#8217;s developer API</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A strong onboarding process keeps users engaged and helps them find value quickly in your service. By integrating Gravatar&#8217;s developer API, you can create a more personalized, friction-free experience from the first interaction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think about your sign-up process. Instead of asking users to fill out multiple fields or upload profile pictures, Gravatar automatically populates this information. Users who already have Gravatar profiles – and there are millions – get a faster, more familiar experience across platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The API opens up creative possibilities beyond basic profile data. Use it to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Create personalized welcome screens.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Show relevant examples based on user industries.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Build community features with consistent user identities.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Maintain professional profiles across multiple services.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Major platforms like WordPress and Slack already use Gravatar to streamline their onboarding, so what are you waiting for?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.gravatar.com/site/implement/\">Check out Gravatar&#8217;s developer documentation</a> to see how easy integration can be.

Yes, it&#8217;s just a small block of text at the bottom of your emails – but it&#8217;s also a powerful tool for making memorable connections and building your professional reputation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is especially important if you&#8217;re reaching out to potential clients, applying for jobs, or trying to grow your network. Your signature can be the difference between someone remembering you or your message getting lost in their inbox.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But here&#8217;s the challenge: <strong>Finding the right balance</strong>. Add too little information and recipients won&#8217;t know enough about you. Add too much, and your signature becomes cluttered, potentially making your emails look unprofessional or even spammy.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s explore how to craft an email signature that makes an impact, including a smart strategy for sharing more about yourself without overwhelming your recipients.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Checklist of elements to consider in your email signature</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before diving into specific elements, remember this: You don&#8217;t need to include everything listed below. In fact, that would be counterproductive. Pick the elements that matter most for your professional goals and match your <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/04/10/personal-branding-tools/\">personal brand</a>. And as you&#8217;ll see later,linking to an online profile, such as your <a href=\"https://gravatar.com/\">Gravatar</a>, is a smart way to share additional information without cramming it all into your signature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the essential elements to consider:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Name and title: </strong>Format as &#8220;Name, Title&#8221; for quick scanning. This is non-negotiable – it&#8217;s the foundation of your signature.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Basic contact details: </strong>Include your primary phone number and email address. If you need multiple numbers, use standard notation: (o) for office, (m) for mobile.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Company information: </strong>Add your company name and department if relevant. For freelancers, your business name or professional title works well.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Visual elements:</strong> A small professional headshot or company logo can increase recognition. But keep it modest – aim for subtlety rather than flash.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Social proof: </strong>Choose 2-3 relevant professional profiles. <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/\">LinkedIn</a> is often essential, while other choices depend on your field. A portfolio site works well for creatives, while <a href=\"https://github.com/\">GitHub</a> is a must for developers. And of course, if you need a versatile profile platform that can display a wide range of information, links, and media, all in a compact design, then a Gravatar profile is a must.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, besides these basic elements, there are also some practical additions that would vary based on your needs:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Calendar booking link if you schedule lots of meetings.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Industry certifications for specialized fields.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Office location or timezone for global teams.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Languages spoken for international work.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pronouns for inclusive communication.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Legal disclaimers if required by your industry.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember: <strong>White space is your friend</strong>. A clean, readable signature beats an overcrowded one every time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Design Tips to make your email signature stand out</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Email signatures need precise design choices to look professional across different devices and email clients. Here&#8217;s how to create one that works everywhere:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Size guidelines that prevent problems:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Keep the total width under 600px – this ensures your signature displays correctly on mobile devices.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Limit height to 150 or 200px maximum to avoid overwhelming your message.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Size company logos at 100x50px.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Set headshots to 80x80px square.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Leave 10px minimum spacing between elements.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Typography and formatting:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Set your name in 14-16px font size – it should be instantly noticeable.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use 11-12px for contact details and other information.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Stick to standard, professional fonts like Arial or Helvetica.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pick two brand colors at most, plus black or gray for text.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Organize information in order of importance.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use simple separators like pipes ( | ) between elements.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Technical requirements to prevent display issues:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Apply inline CSS to maintain consistent formatting.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Structure elements to stack properly on mobile screens.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Test your signature in major email clients (<a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/outlook/email-and-calendar-software-microsoft-outlook\">Outlook</a>, <a href=\"https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/\">Gmail</a>, <a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/mail/\">Apple Mail</a>).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Compress images under 40KB to ensure quick loading.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Hierarchy matters – put your most important information first. Think about what your recipient needs to know right away versus what can go below. A clear structure with proper spacing helps readers find what they need quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Examples of well-designed email signatures</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To help you get inspired, here are some interesting templates from <a href=\"https://www.canva.com/search?q=email+signature\">Canva</a> that really capture what makes a great email signature.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Minimalistic signature without a headshot:&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"330\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/black-white-minimalist-personal-professional-email-signature.png?w=660\" alt=\"Example of a minimalistic email signature for a manager\" class=\"wp-image-2676\" />\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Elegant signature with a photo:&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"330\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/white-simple-real-estate-business-email-signature.png?w=660\" alt=\"Example of a simplistic email signature for a real estate agent \" class=\"wp-image-2677\" />\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Another design for a real estate agent with a cover photo.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"330\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/black-and-yellow-elegant-realtor-email-signature.png?w=660\" alt=\"Example of an email signature for a real estate agent with a cover photo\" class=\"wp-image-2678\" />\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>A very unique approach for a graphic designer, allowing them to show their creativity even through their email signature.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"330\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/orange-green-gradient-creative-graphic-designer-email-signature.png?w=660\" alt=\"Example of an email signature for a graphic designer\" class=\"wp-image-2680\" />\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Automating design with an email signature generator</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While working with a designer gives you the most polished results, email signature generators offer a practical starting point.

Think of it as an extension of your signature – one that updates automatically across all platforms where you use your email.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your Gravatar profile becomes a comprehensive hub for:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Professional background and accomplishments.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Portfolio pieces and project highlights.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Complete set of social media profiles.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Full contact information.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Recent blog posts or updates.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Speaking engagements or events.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The magic happens in the synchronization. Update your Gravatar profile once, and those changes appear everywhere your email is used – including past emails. No need to update multiple signatures or worry about outdated information floating around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This approach solves a common problem: Keeping professional information current across platforms. A hiring manager might find your year-old email with an outdated job title, but clicking your Gravatar link shows them your current role and achievements.</p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://gravatar.com/connect/?gravatar_from=blog\"><img width=\"3243\" height=\"729\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/free_profile_cta.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2616\" /></a>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Crafting CTAs to your Gravatar profile in your email signature</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One option is to add the Gravatar icon to your email signature as you would for any other online profile. This works well, though as Gravatar can be used for a wide range of purposes it might not give your recipients enough context about what they’ll find when they open it. Another option is to link to your Gravatar profile with clear, action-oriented text that hints at the value:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>&#8220;See my complete portfolio and background.&#8221;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>&#8220;Find my latest projects and contact info.&#8221;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>&#8220;Connect with me professionally.&#8221;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>&#8220;View my full professional profile.&#8221;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Match your CTA to your goals. If you&#8217;re job hunting, emphasize your portfolio. For networking, focus on connection opportunities. The right CTA tells recipients exactly what they&#8217;ll gain by clicking through.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Create an effective email signature with the help of Gravatar</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravatar actually makes it super easy. Just login to your profile editor, copy your email signature code, and paste it in. </p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"2086\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/cleanshot-2025-02-18-at-12.24.39402x.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2932\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Here’s how:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Head to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://gravatar.com/profile\">gravatar.com/profile</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>click on&nbsp;<strong><em>Email signature</em></strong>&nbsp;in the bottom left</li>\n\n\n\n<li>grab the code and paste it into Gmail or your email client</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://support.gravatar.com/your-profile/email-signature/\">quick setup guides</a>&nbsp;for Gmail, Apple Mail, and other popular email tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Email signatures perform a delicate balancing act. Add too much information, and you risk looking unprofessional. Add too little and recipients miss important context about who you are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Linking to a Gravatar profile offers an elegant solution. Your email signature stays clean and focused, while still giving recipients access to everything they might want to know about you. Plus, you never have to worry about outdated information lingering in old emails – your Gravatar profile updates everywhere, automatically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s what makes this approach particularly effective:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Recipients get a complete picture of your professional identity.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Your signature stays concise and professional.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Information stays current without manual updates.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Old emails maintain their relevance.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You control how much information to share.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>A well-crafted email signature paired with a Gravatar profile helps you make stronger professional connections. Recipients can learn exactly what they need about you, whether that&#8217;s your latest work, professional background, or preferred contact methods.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ready to enhance your email signature? <a href=\"https://gravatar.com/profile\">Create your free Gravatar profile </a>and start building a more effective professional presence.</p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://gravatar.com/connect/?gravatar_from=blog\"><img width=\"3243\" height=\"729\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/free_profile_cta.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2616\" /></a>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 28 Feb 2025 16:27:08 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Ronnie Burt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:55:\"Do The Woo Community: WordCamp Asia 2025 Photo Memories\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:43:\"https://dothewoo.io/?post_type=blog&p=91875\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"https://dothewoo.io/blog/wordcamp-asia-2025-photo-memories/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:160:\"Well this year I had the opportunity to take just a few more photos despite being incredibly busy with the booth.

His daughter has breathed new life and perspectives into the show, hoping to appeal to a younger generation while retaining his loyal audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re passionate about WordPress, podcasting, or just interested in understanding a holistic approach to long-term content creation and audience engagement, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to wptavern.com/podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you John Overall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast by John Overall, how are you doing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:20] <strong>John Overall:</strong> I am doing fantastic, thanks Nathan. I appreciate being on your show.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:24] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I am really pleased to have John. I want to call you Jonathan. Is there a time when you were a Jonathan or have I just misremembered?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:31] <strong>John Overall:</strong> No, no, I&#8217;ve been called Jonathan, Johnny, Johnny Boy. I answer to all kinds of names. My mom actually calls me Alan because she refuses to call me John.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:40] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Well, it&#8217;s an absolute pleasure having you on the podcast today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Very frequently when I interview people, people tell me that they&#8217;ve listened to my podcast and I find that really, I get quite emotional when people do that, I think that&#8217;s lovely. But the tables are turned, because today I&#8217;m here to say that I have listened to Jonathan&#8217;s podcast many, many times in the past.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I was just saying that there was a period of time in my life when my children went to music lessons. And I used to accompany them to those music lessons, and I had to sit in the, if you call it like a waiting room, basically. Every week I would sit there faithfully listening to your plugin podcast, you know, it was the, we call it A to Z, but you call it A to Z. And I would listen to you talking about plugins, and giving them ratings and what have you with your co-host. And so this is a bit of a stars in my eyes moment. I&#8217;m so pleased to have you on the podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:31] <strong>John Overall:</strong> Well, I appreciate that. And yeah, the WP Plugins A to Z, and we do call it Z here in Canada. But when I had my American co-host in the beginning years, he called it Z. So we used to argue with it. And then we actually have someone, our intro, one of my listeners, he recorded it, and we have a minor intro that says, it&#8217;s WP Plugins, A to Z, not Z. It&#8217;s still something we use. It was generated years ago by one of the listeners. But yeah, it&#8217;s been a longstanding show. It&#8217;s been around for over 16 years now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So I really didn&#8217;t know that podcasts were a thing. And podcasts came into my life at the moment when mobile phones had apps that could do that. I didn&#8217;t listen to them on desktop or anything like that. And it was always for me, a bit of dead time. I wouldn&#8217;t listen to them in the car or anything like that. I would always listen to them in a moment where I was sat in a chair and had nothing else to pay attention to. And I just found them immediately really, really important in my life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I found WordPress. And then quickly found a bunch of podcasts which I listened to, and yours was the one that somehow settled in my brain as the, I&#8217;m going to music now, I&#8217;m going to sit for half an hour and consume the podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And really, without listening to podcasts like yours, my life would&#8217;ve been very different, I think. Because it occurred to me that, as I was listening to you and your co-host talk, I got a sense of, well, you&#8217;re not a media personality. You are not somebody who is sitting in some sort of CNN type studio producing content. You are a guy that does the kind of job that I do. And I got a real sense of, gosh, maybe this is something that I could explore at some point. And there we go, and the rest is history. That&#8217;s now all I&#8217;ve done for many years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:07] <strong>John Overall:</strong> Well I will gladly take the credit for expanding podcasting. I&#8217;ve enjoyed podcasting since the beginning. I discovered it as I graduated from my applied communication program at college, which led me into the internet. And it was shortly after that that we saw the rise of it. And of course, Adam Curry from the No Agenda Show, who is known as the Pod Father, he created podcasting as it stands today with the RSS feeds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And he&#8217;s even ensured that it&#8217;s going to stay a free and open source platform due to the now existing podcasting index. Which is where everybody gets that in their newfangled apps. Like I quit using the apps from the Apple store for my podcast. I use the newer apps, because they do a much better job and they go into the podcast and index for everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, yeah, it&#8217;s really great. And the nice thing is, what it did was allowed me, with WordPress in particular, was to expand my knowledge. Because I used it to build my knowledge. I saw WordPress and what it was doing with the plugins. Because in the beginning, WordPress was great for a blogging platform. I started using it probably about version two, so they were like two, maybe two and a half years old when I discovered WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;d seen it once before when it first came out, and one of my clients put it on my server and I almost banned it from my server because its use of resources was ridiculous. It was literally crashing one of my servers. But I ended up working with it, and it kept getting better and better and better. And then when they introduced the plugins to it, to expand it into a full CMS, I went, oh dear God, this is going to be huge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;ve watched it as it climbed from like, I went back recently to look at my first episodes. My first episode there was less than 9,000 plugins available for WordPress. I watched it grow and grow and grow and grow. And now there&#8217;s over, hundreds of thousands of plugins. The WordPress repository has only 50,000. At one point they had 90,000, so they&#8217;ve cleaned out a big mess, it has expanded it, and it&#8217;s going to take, you know, WordPress is going into, it&#8217;s in a changing mode right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress is in a massive flux right now, with all the things that have occurred in the last six months. But many people have been panicking, oh my God, It&#8217;s going to go away. It&#8217;s like, no, it&#8217;s not going anywhere. It&#8217;s going to change, and a lot of things are going to be different, but there&#8217;s too many people in the world making a living, depending upon their daily bread, their monthly rents, having WordPress fully functioning. And there&#8217;s companies that are as big as Automattic, if not bigger, that are using WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was reading an article yesterday of the top 12 websites built in WordPress. We&#8217;re talking NASA, The Times magazine, well, we know whitehouse.gov is using it. And you look at them and some of them are just insanely developed. And if it wasn&#8217;t for the plugin capability of WordPress, it wouldn&#8217;t be possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:52] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> When you look back over all those years, so rewind until, let&#8217;s say the month, the year before you began your podcast journey, what was the thing that kicked you into doing podcasting? Was it just like a bit of serendipity? Did you know that you wanted to create audio content or was it just a bit of an accident?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:09] <strong>John Overall:</strong> It was a bit of everything. What it really was, was I was just starting, I had just sold my computer store, so I was working off of money from selling a successful sale of a computer store I had for several years. Because I sold out the computer industry just before it went full mobile and impossible to really make a living with a computer store. And I was going back to the internet and developing websites and I was exploring things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I looked at Drupal, Joomla and WordPress, trying to figure out what would be the best CMS system so I wouldn&#8217;t have to write PHP code, and CSS by hand anymore, or at least minimise it. And I needed a way to reach people. And one of the ways, podcasts was just starting to pick up at that time, that was somewhere around 2010, 2011, right around there. And it was just starting to pick up, and I realised, wait a minute, people are listening to the podcast. I can start putting out a podcast and I can focus. And I looked at WordPress and I realised, you know, what would be the best component to focus on in WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I chose plugins. And I went, okay, well I needed a domain. I went, WP Plugins, well, A to Z. And I had this really crazy idea at the beginning, because there was so few plugins, I was going to cover WordPress plugins, literally from A to Z. My first 20 episodes was A, B, C, D plugins starting with those letters. I got that far into it and I went, okay, this ain&#8217;t going to work, there&#8217;s no way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And people were adding them at a continuous rate every week. And I went, okay, this isn&#8217;t going to work, but it still constitutes, the name constituted everything. So I just started diving into what I thought was the best plugins, or if I used the plugin and I thought wasn&#8217;t very good, it was a way to warn people, please, avoid this plugin. Don&#8217;t make my mistake.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it was all of those things. So it was a little bit of serendipity, but what I was more after was growing my business. And it literally did grow my business for several years. I would suddenly get a call, or an email from people, because I put my email and everything into the shows. I would get emails from listeners saying, hey, I&#8217;ve been listening to your show for several months and I&#8217;m having this WordPress problem, and you talked about it. Can you fix it? And I said, well, hold on, let&#8217;s see what we can do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I still have six or seven clients from those early years, that have been clients ever since they came to me. And they came to me because, when people listen to you on podcasts they begin to trust you. They start to feel like they know who you are, because they&#8217;ve been listening to you. You&#8217;re a friend, you&#8217;re not a stranger. And because of that, what happens, I had people, they would contact me and I asked them for, I&#8217;m really cautious about what information I get from my clients to access their stuff, their hosting or whatever. And I get people and I ask them for this, and all of a sudden they&#8217;ve given me all of their keys to their castle. And they have no idea who I am. They don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m trustworthy of that, but I&#8217;ve built that trust by the way they&#8217;ve heard me talk over the however period of time, months or years they&#8217;ve listened to my show.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:55] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It is interesting because from your perspective, you haven&#8217;t given out any metric which might be a measure of trust, but you have. You really have. I mean, giving that much time and putting out your thoughts, and speaking like you speak, and talking like you talk, and the language that you use, and the way that you present yourself, it does lend trust.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it is very, very similar with the podcasts that I listen to, dozens that I listen to each week. And I really do get a feeling that I know these people. I never thought of using a podcast as a marketing tool to be honest. But I do remember the sort of bits that you would drop in, and I thought, yeah, that was kind of interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, perfect, it ended up creating new business, not just a bit of fun that you had to crowbar into each week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:38] <strong>John Overall:</strong> It literally helped build my business, and it made it successful to sustain me for many years. And that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve enjoyed. That&#8217;s part of what I&#8217;ve enjoyed about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other is, I got to meet lots of people virtually, all over the globe. In addition to the, well, we&#8217;re going to do episode 642 next week, and in addition to those episodes for just the WP plugins, I did interview shows, which were a separate episode. And I&#8217;ve done over 150 of those over the years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus I&#8217;ve also had three or four other podcasts, I kept thinking I was going to start different podcasts for different things, and I&#8217;d get maybe 20, 30, 100, 200 episodes into them, and then that&#8217;s like, okay, I don&#8217;t have time for these ones anymore, and they just fall by the wayside. In total I&#8217;ve probably got 2000 episodes of podcasts behind me for various podcasts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:23] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You really are a veteran of this industry. How has it changed? Just for those of us who are podcasting nowadays, it&#8217;s so simple. There&#8217;s a tool for everything. There&#8217;s a SaaS platform for everything. You can pay your monthly subscription, and it&#8217;ll more or less podcast for you really. But back in the day, when I started there were definite hurdles, but you were many, many years before me. So I&#8217;m imagining there was lots of hurdles to overcome just to get the thing out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:49] <strong>John Overall:</strong> In the beginning it was really hard, especially if you had a host, a co-host. It&#8217;s like we didn&#8217;t have the easy software like we&#8217;re using right now for recording back and forth. Even now, I don&#8217;t use this software for doing mine. I use Microsoft Teams for recording with my co-host. But in the beginning we had, oh, what the heck was it called?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:08] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I&#8217;ll tell you what I used at the beginning and this will kind of date me. I used Skype.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:13] <strong>John Overall:</strong> That&#8217;s it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:13] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That was it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:14] <strong>John Overall:</strong> That was it? Skype? I was trying to remember what it was. It still loads on my computer when I reboot my computer and I have to shut it off because I just haven&#8217;t got around to, well, I haven&#8217;t rebuilt my computer for almost 10 years. I&#8217;m getting a new one this next year, because my computer&#8217;s finally ending its life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But yeah, Skype. And the other thing was, is we didn&#8217;t have the easy ways to clean up the audio feed that we have now. You get those high pitch wines, or bad cable, or background noise, or whatever, or even the mismatched audio levels. You had to actually go in and kind of edit that a little bit to get your audio as clean as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because the biggest thing from the beginning I knew is, it doesn&#8217;t really matter what you&#8217;re talking about, if the audio&#8217;s not clean, people will stop listening. If the audio&#8217;s got annoying noises or something, or they can&#8217;t quite hear, or one host is suddenly blaring in the air and the other host is like a mouse talking in the other ear, they go, oh, I can&#8217;t listen to this. And they won&#8217;t listen to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:09] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Do you know, it&#8217;s really interesting because somebody warned me of this right at the beginning of my podcast journey, and they framed it even more than that. They said that if you&#8217;re watching a video and the quality of the video is poor, you&#8217;ll forgive that. But you&#8217;ll never forgive bad audio. You just can&#8217;t watch something on, let&#8217;s say, YouTube or a film or whatever if the audio is crackly or distorted. There&#8217;s just nothing, you know, unless you can lip read, there&#8217;s nothing coming at you that&#8217;s useful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I remember taking that to heart and thinking, okay, that&#8217;s important. But then being frustrated by the technology that, just things like Skype couldn&#8217;t keep up. There&#8217;d be dropouts in everything, and so editing was a nightmare.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:48] <strong>John Overall:</strong> Yes, it was. And although pretty much all my shows are live to tape, I discovered a program that&#8217;s called Level Later. And it&#8217;s a very old program, but what it does is you can take any audio file with multiple levels in it, you throw it into this, it runs it through some passes, some computer magic, and it comes out and all the levels are perfect in it. And I&#8217;ve been using Level Later for years now, because no matter how hard I try, I can never get the levels perfect when I&#8217;m recording it between two hosts. Because I&#8217;m not using intermediate software that&#8217;s doing it for me. I record mine straight to OBS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:22] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, if you are thinking about getting into the podcasting world, and we can decide whether or not that&#8217;s useful these days given the dearth of podcasts. But if you are, honestly, it&#8217;s so straightforward now. I&#8217;m using, currently, an app called SquadCast, but there&#8217;s a whole bunch of rivals out there in the marketplace. There&#8217;s things like Riverside.FM and many, many others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they allow you to record through a browser, and in this case, John&#8217;s track and my track will be isolated, I&#8217;ll download them both. And so that never happened. Before it was just one track that you had to, if your audio is mucky, then so was mine. There was no way of separating those two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But now yours will come separately, mine will come separately, and if I&#8217;ve got 10 guests, they&#8217;ll all be separate. And then I throw them into, similar to you, I throw them into an app which basically cleans things up and automatically levels things. And then will create transcripts, and it&#8217;s just miraculous. It&#8217;s so, so straightforward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:13] <strong>John Overall:</strong> It&#8217;s gotten really good. I&#8217;m, re-embracing all of that stuff. For the last four years, I&#8217;d taken my business down to the minimal levels of what I had to put into it, and I focused on my farmstead that I have, my urban farmstead. And in this last year I realised I needed to get back to my roots, and my WordPress and all of my other work. And so this last year we&#8217;ve been rebuilding everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the WP Plugin show, it went off the rails for a little while. I got a little political for a little while and lost a large chunk of my audience, and a lot of them are coming back now because I&#8217;ve got it back to what it was, the show it was before. It is allowing everything, and also I&#8217;ve got a new co-host in there, my daughter, been training in my business for the last five years to take over this business as I get ready for retirement time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She&#8217;s become my co-host on there. In fact, she&#8217;s more of the host than I am now. She does more of the talking and more of the direction of the show each week. Which is kind of interesting. It makes for a more interesting show, having a different viewpoint on it than mine. Because I think I went, when Marcus left the show back in 2016 or 17, and I did like four years of just me on the show. And it&#8217;s really hard to be a single host on a show week after week after week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:27] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I feel your pain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:28] <strong>John Overall:</strong> That&#8217;s why you need guests or you need to have a co-host to help keep some life in it. Anyone who tries to do a podcast, like podcasts nowadays. Yeah, anyone can do them and, yes, there is a dearth of them, but the problem is, if you go look at those podcasts, about 80% of them never make it past episode 30.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:45] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Or even, I mean, it&#8217;s probably like 50% past episode one in all honesty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:50] <strong>John Overall:</strong> Yeah that too. They find out, wait a minute, this is a lot of work, and it&#8217;s really hard. It&#8217;s usually the ones that try to do it by themselves and they&#8217;ve got the momentum for the first 10, 15 episodes. After that, you&#8217;ve got to keep pushing yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:02] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, there&#8217;s a grind, isn&#8217;t there? And although we&#8217;ve just made the case that making a podcast is straightforward, from a technological point of view, it&#8217;s easier than ever. But the grind hasn&#8217;t gone away. And in fact, new grind has been added in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when you began, and when I began, social media was a bit of a thing, but not really. It wasn&#8217;t kind of an essential component. But now it&#8217;s almost like the only distribution mechanism, outside of RSS, and perhaps a WordPress website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of those pieces have kind of got bundled in. So you have to make sure to promote it, and cross-promote it, and create, I don&#8217;t know, alternative, different snippets of it that go on this platform and that platform. So there&#8217;s a whole load of other things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It isn&#8217;t something that, unless you&#8217;ve got a real passion for it, it&#8217;s something that, like you said, episode 30 is probably going to be where you get and give in because you start in New Year, brand new, New Year&#8217;s resolution. January, I&#8217;m going to do a podcast, and you keep going for a little while. And I was telling you that there are very few things in my life where I&#8217;ve had the capacity to stick at it, but podcasting for some reason has worked for me. I guess I just like listening to my own voice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:05] <strong>John Overall:</strong> There&#8217;s that aspect too, listening to your own voice. Sometimes I listen to myself and I go, really? That&#8217;s me? You don&#8217;t get used to that. No matter all these years, I still can&#8217;t get used to my voice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the other thing is, for some people, a lot of people use it to help improve their knowledge in their particular area they&#8217;re podcasting about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I like history podcasts from time to time. And those ones there, it means it&#8217;s a serious history buff doing a podcast about something he&#8217;s excited about. And what he&#8217;s getting a chance to do is share to the world what he&#8217;s doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same I do with WordPress, I share things to everybody about what is in the WordPress world and what&#8217;s changing. And now our show has moved in a different direction. We dropped down from the number of plugins we do each week. We have more discussion about things we see happening. There&#8217;s new segments coming into the show that&#8217;ll be talking about, here&#8217;s a problem in WordPress we found, how we solved it, coming from my daughter&#8217;s perspective, who, she&#8217;s five years into this, so she&#8217;s relatively new and everything. It&#8217;s like everything&#8217;s brand new to her. A lot of it&#8217;s all, oh yeah, it&#8217;s just CSS. I don&#8217;t understand that Dad. And I was like, oh yeah, you&#8217;re kind of new at this. I have to explain things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when I&#8217;ve discovered problems, there&#8217;s problems I can solve in like 20 minutes and it takes her five hours because she doesn&#8217;t know where to go to see the problem. These are what I&#8217;m starting to bring back to the show. Stuff that used to be in the show and it had gotten lost along the way. And it&#8217;s also we&#8217;re talking about what we see changing in the WordPress environment, and how we see this environment evolving over the next couple years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We did a show, our Christmas and New Year&#8217;s shows were prerecorded. We do prerecorded shows usually about that time, so we can spend time with the family and not worry about the show. But we&#8217;d made predictions of what was coming in the New Year that hadn&#8217;t yet come to pass. By the time we did our first show, a week and a half ago, by the time we did our first show for the New Year, we had already had two or three successful predictions of what was changing in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re both starting to see this, which is exciting in the fact that, oh, okay, this sort of event is going to happen in WordPress and this is where it&#8217;s going to go. With all the doom and gloom, as I mentioned, the doom and gloom as I see, like I follow the forums over at the Reddits, and Twitters, and all over the place because I get our news from everywhere to keep up. And I see a lot of people, doom and gloom of people abandoning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I tried abandoning WordPress at the introduction of Gutenberg. I even took my show towards ClassicPress. And that happened for about two years. And then I realised, unfortunately, ClassicPress didn&#8217;t have a community momentum behind it, and WordPress kept going. Even though I currently build in WordPress, I don&#8217;t use Gutenberg, because no matter how many times I try to wrap my head around it, I can&#8217;t get my brain to think that way. And so I use Elementor for all my builds. And it allows me to continue using the Classic Editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that sort of thing is going to continue. They were going to supposedly stop supporting the Classic Editor, but unfortunately it&#8217;s not happening, because a good 50% of the WordPress community still uses the Classic Editor, and a page builder of some sort. Versus 50% that are using Gutenberg. And they can live together. It took me a while to realise that they can live together. You just have to work with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a couple of clients who use Gutenberg. I can sort of muck my way through it if I really work at it. But it&#8217;s going to continue, and these things are going to keep changing and evolving. The WordPress plugins, I&#8217;ve seen the developers creating some amazing developments. When we just launched the new website for our business, we actually have a whole WP Pro A to Z lineup, WP Plugins, WP Pro A to Z.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we launched our new site, I found a plugin I didn&#8217;t know existed, which will be coming in one of my shows, upcoming. If you need a booking plugin and you use Gravity Forms, somebody wrote a full blown addition to Gravity Forms for a booking plugin. So you don&#8217;t have to go spend money on another third party service or a service as a software, SaaS service where you&#8217;re putting out money. You pay for this one plugin, integrate it into Gravity Forms and you get everything. And now it&#8217;s all in one form and you still control your data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:07] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I really like the idea that you had of having that kind of theme running through, because in any of the podcasts I do, basically each episode is atomised, you know, it&#8217;s just an episode and then you listen to a different one, and there&#8217;s no real connection necessarily between the episodes. And I really like the idea of having a thread which runs through.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also, I am really curious about plugins in particular, and I would love to have the excuse to play with them. Because then it would be, air quotes, then it would be work suddenly. The excuse of, what are you doing? I&#8217;m doing work. I&#8217;m playing with a plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:39] <strong>John Overall:</strong> Play with a plugin, figuring it out, throw it on one of my dozens of domains that I&#8217;m doing nothing with, that collect all kinds of stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, the other joy is, as you mentioned with plugins, is of course, because once developers rediscover us, and the way we review stuff, and we give honest reviews, we tell them, truthfully what we find wrong and what we don&#8217;t. We give a good, honest rating. It&#8217;s very seldom we&#8217;ll give a rating as low as a two, but it has happened in the past.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We don&#8217;t automatically like give it a five, it has to be worthy of a five. Most of them fall between three and four, which is where most of them are anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the other joy is, is I get developers, they got a premium plugin and they go, hey, you want to check it out and I say, yeah, give me your premium plugin and a license, all give it a review.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I get to play with premium plugins without having to spend the money on them, which is a joy. But it also allows people to find out what it might do. And the other thing that&#8217;s coming again, I used to have training videos, create training videos on how to use plugins. In fact, my training videos on my YouTube channel, some of them are still some of my highest rated plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:38] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I feel that I was really lucky being in the WordPress community, then discovering podcasting. Because I feel like all the pieces of the jigsaw, which go into making a podcast, are easily handled with WordPress. And so that was just a nice bit of serendipity. If you understand how to put a website up, well, that&#8217;s one thing you kind of really do need if you&#8217;re going to have a podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there&#8217;s plugins which will handle the RSS feed. There&#8217;s plugins which will handle the contact forms. There&#8217;s plugins which will handle the display of your website if you&#8217;re not using Core. And so I felt that talking about WordPress, and having the capacity to use WordPress was a real boon for me. Just made the whole thing much more straightforward. But like you&#8217;re describing about your daughter, not the same for everybody.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:21] <strong>John Overall:</strong> Yeah, well, one of the interesting things about, when you mentioned a plugin for this and a plugin for that, you remember the early days of the Apple advertising, There&#8217;s an app for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:29] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> For the iPhone, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:30] <strong>John Overall:</strong> We used to say for the longest time, well, there&#8217;s a plugin for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:32] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. And there was.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:34] <strong>John Overall:</strong> There literally was, and there still is. And if you don&#8217;t think there is, it&#8217;s easy enough to build. It&#8217;s like, I&#8217;ve actually gone so far, in the last couple of years, to pay developers to create plugins for me. Sometime around the end of this year we&#8217;ll be introducing a plugin that has not been created yet for any of the things on WordPress. We&#8217;ve been working on something, and so that&#8217;s a little tidbit of what&#8217;s coming. As we get closer to the beta release, which is expected, the beta release is expected September, October of this year. Then we&#8217;ll be talking more and more in depth about this plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:07] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Do you still intend to keep going with your podcast into the, basically into the future, forever? Do you have a sort of timeline, like when you get to, I don&#8217;t know, a thousand episodes of this particular podcast, that&#8217;ll be it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:18] <strong>John Overall:</strong> As long as the show has still got listeners, and some audience, and it still provides value for what we do, no. Because one of the biggest things, and even my daughters realised this. Because she has to do research for every episode, because a lot of people don&#8217;t realizse, okay, you do a podcast, oh, it&#8217;s about an hour long. They don&#8217;t realise that that hour long required three to four hours of research in preparation of your notes and everything for the show, plus whatever post-production, everything else. By the time you&#8217;re done, a one hour show is usually a five to seven hour investment of time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The thing is, when you&#8217;re doing that research, what it does is that increases your knowledge, because you&#8217;re looking at things you hadn&#8217;t looked at before, and it helps increase and input more knowledge into you, and expand your knowledge as an expert in the field. Many, many people started podcasts as a side hobby, and turned into experts in their field, because of their podcast. That&#8217;s what it forces you to do, is it forces you to become an expert in whatever field your podcast focuses on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:18] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Did you ever get into creating podcast websites for people?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:22] <strong>John Overall:</strong> No.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:22] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> No, me neither. And there&#8217;s some part of me which regrets that, because I think that would&#8217;ve been a real good wheelhouse for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:28] <strong>John Overall:</strong> It would&#8217;ve been, and it would&#8217;ve been except for, you would&#8217;ve been changing a lot, and the investment in time and the screenshots for it would be even higher than the investment in time I&#8217;ve got now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was all about how much investment in time versus the return on that investment in time. It is how I&#8217;ve done it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I did training videos, and my training videos are still some of the highest viewed videos on YouTube, and they&#8217;re old and ancient now, and they&#8217;re out of date. And I even got a question from one of the training videos, what was it, a couple of months ago, somebody contacted me and asked me questions. I said, oh, dear God, I forgot I did that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when I went and looked at it, I said, I&#8217;m sorry, it&#8217;s out of date. I haven&#8217;t used that plugin in four or five years now, so I don&#8217;t know. And this is the problem of it. And so I&#8217;m starting to create new ones, partly because I&#8217;m creating these training videos for my clients to be able to manage their sites. Because my job as a web designer is not to manage their website forever, but build them a website that they can do all their own content and not keep having me having to put the content in, because they don&#8217;t want to pay the fees for simple things like adding content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so we build websites to do that, but they need instructions on how to do it. So we build nice, simple training videos that they can go look at and remind themselves how to do it. And so I&#8217;m actually starting to do that with the plugins again. And for plugins, in fact, one of my training videos for a plugin I did a few years ago, the plugin developer adopted that video right into their code as their training video for how to use the plugin. I do do very detailed, and something people told me was, I&#8217;m very good at translating geek to English.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that was the nice thing is, if you try to tell them how to do it in geek, and a lot of computer guys, they can&#8217;t translate geek to English.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:09] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Also you have this strange thing on an audio podcast where in many cases you&#8217;re trying to describe the functionality of something, which would be so much easier if you could just see it. So it does this, and the way it does this, oh, okay, and you have to try and explain it. And sometimes that involves saying, well, you have to tick this box over here, and then go over here, and do this, and this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it really does make you stop and think, what&#8217;s the best way to describe this? What&#8217;s going to work? What&#8217;s not going to work? And I think you&#8217;re right, it does make you think around the problem. They say that if you can teach something, then you truly understand it. I think there&#8217;s a little bit of that in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:42] <strong>John Overall:</strong> That was the other thing I did in the beginning of WordPress. I actually taught WordPress. I had courses here in Victoria where I live. I had night classes that people would sign up and come pay me money to teach them how to use WordPress. And I did those for about, all the way up until version four of WordPress when YouTube got flooded with tutorials and my courses became irrelevant. But for a few years, that was another way I expanded my knowledge was I taught it to people, because in preparation to teach it, I had to know what I was telling people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:10] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You mentioned that there was a period of time where you fell out with podcasting or it fell out with you, or whatever it may be. You sort of dropped away from it. Did you find though, that when you came back, you mentioned that the audience is sort of still there? The curious thing for me is, I noticed this just the other day, a podcast that is in my podcast player that I have never listened to for years, and the reason I haven&#8217;t listened is because they just went away, but it&#8217;s still there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then they came back. RSS is a bit brilliant like that. Because there&#8217;s no algorithm feeding it to you, there&#8217;s no algorithm like on YouTube saying, okay, now what about this. It jumped right to the top of my playlist. And I suddenly thought, gosh, I haven&#8217;t seen that one for a while. Click play, and the first words were, we&#8217;re back, we&#8217;ve had a couple of years off or whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I thought that was really cool. So I did wonder if your audience, by just mere fact of the way RSS readers work, and RSS feeds work with podcast players, if they&#8217;d stock with you, even though they didn&#8217;t know they were sticking with you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:05] <strong>John Overall:</strong> I&#8217;d say about one third of my audience, in truth, I never left it entirely. We would always put out a episode of WP Plugins A to Z. We would put out an episode, at worst it fell to an episode a month is what happened. It was never completely off the air. But the audience dropped down to, we&#8217;re about one third right now the audience we used to have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And a lot of them left me during my period of despair with the world, is lack of a better term. A lot of them left me during that period there. I chased a few of them away. Some of them I will earn back, some of them I won&#8217;t. Some of them have retired, I imagine, because what was interesting is my audience for the most part is as old or almost as old as me. And I&#8217;m pushing, you know, the upper echelons of fifties now. Because I&#8217;ve been doing this since my early forties. And some people, they&#8217;ve aged out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re actually, because my daughter is a millennial, she&#8217;s in her thirties now, we&#8217;re going after the people in her audience segment. We&#8217;re changing our audience focus. We&#8217;re no longer worried about the old time geeks, the ones that know what they&#8217;re doing. We want the younger people who don&#8217;t know where they&#8217;re going, what they&#8217;re doing, they&#8217;re looking for advice, they want to do these things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re working the audience to go after the younger generation, the millennials and the Zoomers, who are just now coming up into, okay, I need to build a business. What do I choose for building my website? Do I go with WordPress? Do I go with Shopify? Do I get Wix? Do I go crazy and go on a Drupal website? You know, it&#8217;s like, what are they going to do?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so we&#8217;re hoping that we can find these people that are hunting, and get them to look to us for the expertise and advice, and come see me. Like, I now have 25, actually 26 years now of experience in this industry. So I&#8217;ve just started offering consulting services for building a website. Because a lot of people don&#8217;t realise it&#8217;s like, you can dive into your website and you can spend, what&#8217;s your time worth? Is your time worth money, or is it not as valuable?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you can spend the next 70, 80 hours trying to figure things out. Or do you want to buy a few hours of my time and get some direction, and save yourself hours and hours of time, and know where you&#8217;re going with your website. Like, we&#8217;ve been fortunate enough to, in the last couple of years, build some very high frontend websites such as we rebuilt the website for the sierraclub.bc.ca, here in Western Canada.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we&#8217;ve had a few high-end websites like that we&#8217;ve built the last couple of years, to be able to showcase the kind of work and capabilities we have now. So it helps show that, yes, we have expertise in this. And I&#8217;m just going back and tying into all my years of knowledge now and bringing it back forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:44] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I think that&#8217;s a really credible thing to be able to show as well. You know, I&#8217;ve been doing a podcast for 15 odd years or something, it&#8217;s definitely a lot of credibility. But also I think it&#8217;s great that you&#8217;ve managed to sort of co-opt your daughter into it. So not only has that breathed a whole new generation of an audience into the podcast, but it&#8217;s also binding you to a family member, a close family member, and I think that&#8217;s lovely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:05] <strong>John Overall:</strong> Yeah, well, I&#8217;m also trying to co-op my granddaughters into it too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:08] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Really a different generation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:10] <strong>John Overall:</strong> Neither one of my sons are much interested in technology, they&#8217;re so, so. But my oldest son&#8217;s become an electrician. My youngest son is looking at possibly going into trades as a welder. But my oldest son definitely is being an electrician, he starts as an apprentice as soon as he graduates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s really good to bring in your next generations. If you have them, bring them in. If they&#8217;re excited in any way, find which component of your business they might be excited in, and put them into it. That&#8217;s one less person you have to worry about. And you can help ensure that maybe your business will last a couple of generations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:43] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Well, Jonathan, unfortunately time has got the better of us. I really appreciate all of the content that you&#8217;ve put out there. I hope that it carries on and you&#8217;ll be able to make the new show with your daughter a real success. Where do people find you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:55] <strong>John Overall:</strong> You can find us online at two places, WP Plugins, A to Z, or Z for the Americans .com. And that&#8217;s where the show is hosted at. And all of our show notes are there. And you can also find us at wpproatoz.com. That&#8217;s our company website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I will definitely put all of those links into the show notes. Jonathan Overall, thank you so much for chatting to me today. I really appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:19] <strong>John Overall:</strong> Thanks a lot, Nathan. It&#8217;s been a pleasure.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://wppluginsatoz.com/\">John Overall</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>John is a veteran in the WordPress podcasting world, bringing over 16 years of experience with the WP Plugins A to Z show. He&#8217;s an early adopter of WordPress, and has seen the platform evolve and grow, and has built a wealth of knowledge around plugins, which he thinks have been pivotal to WordPress&#8217;s versatility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>John shares his journey into the world of podcasting, initially using it as a tool to grow his business, and expand his expertise within the WordPress ecosystem.

Our hope is that every WordCamp attendee leaves with new knowledge, new friends, and new inspiration to build a better web.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2025/02/20250220-DSC_1853.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-18533\" /><button class=\"lightbox-trigger\" type=\"button\">\n			\n				\n			\n		</button>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2025/02/20250221-T2S_5388.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-18547\" /><button class=\"lightbox-trigger\" type=\"button\">\n			\n				\n			\n		</button>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2025/02/20250220-DSC_1877.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-18535\" /><button class=\"lightbox-trigger\" type=\"button\">\n			\n				\n			\n		</button>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2025/02/20250220-DSC_1800.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-18523\" /><button class=\"lightbox-trigger\" type=\"button\">\n			\n				\n			\n		</button>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2025/02/20250220-DSC_1861.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-18532\" /><button class=\"lightbox-trigger\" type=\"button\">\n			\n				\n			\n		</button>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2025/02/20250220-DSC_1860.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-18529\" /><button class=\"lightbox-trigger\" type=\"button\">\n			\n				\n			\n		</button>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2025/02/20250221-250221_12-35-12_N7A00461_NExT.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-18545\" /><button class=\"lightbox-trigger\" type=\"button\">\n			\n				\n			\n		</button>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2025/02/20250221-DSC_2549.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-18543\" /><button class=\"lightbox-trigger\" type=\"button\">\n			\n				\n			\n		</button>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2025/02/20250221-IMG_3709.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-18546\" /><button class=\"lightbox-trigger\" type=\"button\">\n			\n				\n			\n		</button>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2025/02/20250222-b9848a28-a181-47dc-80af-4d2eb6a72756.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-18540\" /><button class=\"lightbox-trigger\" type=\"button\">\n			\n				\n			\n		</button>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Be sure to mark your calendars for other major WordPress events in 2025: <a href=\"https://europe.wordcamp.org/2025/\">WordCamp Europe</a> (Basel, Switzerland) and<a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2025/\"> WordCamp US</a> (Portland, Oregon, USA).

We have attendees from 71 countries, over 1,800 tickets sold, and contributor day had over 700 people! It&#8217;s an interesting contrast to US and EU WordCamps as well in that the audience is definitely a lot younger, and there&#8217;s very little interest in &#8220;wpdrama&#8221; du jour, in fact I&#8217;ve had tons of amazing conversations of support and talking about the strength and growth of the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the earliest international WordCamps I went to were in Manila and Davao, back in 2008. (I&#8217;m going to share some pictures at the start of my talk.) Between that and spending lots of time in Daly City when I moved to San Francisco when I was 20 I have developed a fondness for the cuisine, creativity, family orientation, and warmth of the culture here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After this I&#8217;ll be taking a bit of time off for a trip to the big Hindu religious pilgrimage in India, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumbh_Mela\">Maha Kumbh Mela</a>, which is currently on a 144 cycle. It&#8217;s the largest human gathering in the world, with some days measured with tens of millions of people visiting. I&#8217;ll be returning to my Photomatt roots as well and bringing my big camera rig, right now a Nikon Z 7II, and two lenses: 24-70 2.8 and 70-200 2.8.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 22 Feb 2025 06:01:19 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:47:\"Do The Woo Community: Do the Woo v5.0 Changelog\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:43:\"https://dothewoo.io/?post_type=blog&p=91258\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"https://dothewoo.io/blog/do-the-woo-v5-0-changelog/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"Version 5.0 2025-02-20 You can see our entire changelog here.\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 20 Feb 2025 11:46:48 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"Do The Woo Community: Do the Woo v5.0 is in the Wild at WordCamp Asia 2025\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=91204\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"https://dothewoo.io/do-the-woo-v5-0-is-in-the-wild-at-wordcamp-asia-2025/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:354:\"In this episode, BobWP announces the launch of version 5.0 at WordCamp Asia, featuring a redesigned homepage that emphasizes multimedia content.
